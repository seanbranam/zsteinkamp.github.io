# Sea of Love
A while back I was running by the railroad tracks near my house and had the idea to use a sample from the Honeydrippers' version of Sea of Love, specifically the "I" in "I want to tell you...". The way Robert Plant sang that has so much character, I thought it could be the basis of something else. I took more samples than that from the song and made something very different from it.

Bahar sent me a recording she made of the parrots that live in our neighborhood, and that became the intro.

The main melody sound is a note sampled from the Stylophone that Derek gave me many years ago. Other sounds are egg shakers I keep at my music desk, the squeaky shelf that seems to get play in all my songs, and other synth sounds I made.
