    description: "<h3>Thursday</h3>\r\nThursday had us up and ready for breakfast
      at 7am.  After some excellent cappuccinos and food, we again met Pablo at the
      hotel entrance to begin the day's adventure.  Today we were going to ride the
      ATVs to a zip line place just outside of Mal Pais.\r\n\r\nZip lines are steel
      cables strung between trees.  You wear a harness around your legs and waist,
      with a nylon strap coming up from the middle that attaches to a pulley.  You
      hook up to the pulley, and let gravity zip you from tree to tree.  You wear
      heavy leather gloves, and use one hand as a brake on the line.  Without the
      brake, the ending can be, uh, dramatic.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the place in about
      20 minutes on the ATVs.  After a quick ground school lesson, we piled into the
      bed of a pickup and drove up a steep grade to the top of a hill.  We were going
      to go down 9 zip lines, returning to where we started, zig-zagging through the
      trees down the hill.\r\n\r\nThe guys running the place were pros, as was Pablo.
      \ The first time was a little bit scary, since we were to climb up a rickety
      platform suspended in a tree, and then jump off with a 20-100 foot drop below.
      \ After the first one though, we learned to trust the equipment and the guys
      that were hooking us up to the pulleys.\r\n\r\nA video of Arti taking off on
      a zip line:\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mVyOVMFCQT4\"
      frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nPablo suggested I try the
      \"Superman\" on the longest, fastest line.  Of course I complied, not knowing
      exactly what this was to be.  Normally the strap that connects the harness to
      the pulley comes up from around your belt buckle area, and you zip down in a
      position similar to sitting on a chaise lounge.  With the Superman, the attachment
      strap is moved to the back, so you are suspended face down, and attached to
      another person who is managing the braking.  I got into position, and one of
      the guys who works there hooked me up to his pulley.  He showed me my pulley
      and said \"cuarenta [forty] kilometers per hora\".  He pointed to his and with
      a big smile said \"<i>setenta</i> [seventy] kilometers per hora\".\r\n\r\nSo
      there I was, standing in front of the zip line master guy with my back to him,
      my attachment strap hooked to his 70kph pulley, him behind me.  \"Give me one
      leg,\" he said, so I raised one leg back.  \"Ok, now the other one\", now I
      was suspended, looking down at the treetops below.  The zipline stretches FAR
      into the distance.  \"Ready?\"  \"Oh yeah...\" and then off we went.  HOLY CRAP.
      \ This was amazing.  Really really amazing, FLYING just above the trees SO FAST,
      hearing the high-pitched whine of the pulley, zipping past branches and through
      holes between trees, with my arms out like a bird.  I was just screaming like
      crazy it was such an absolutely terrific experience!!!  The landing platform
      came into view and I heard and felt the brake come in.  We landed perfectly
      on the platform.  Huge high-five for the helper, and a huge smile for the rest
      of the day for me.\r\n\r\nWe finished out the remaining lines, none more exciting
      than that one though.\r\n\r\nAfter the zip lines, we hopped on the ATVs and
      rode to a spot outside of Montezuma to hike to a waterfall.  We parked in an
      unmarked spot, and walked along a hillside trail to a really magnificent place
      with water tumbling down rocks, then a 10 foot drop to a tree-lined pool, which
      then led to a 40 foot drop to another pool, then another 50 foot drop to the
      final pool.  Pablo had dove off all three, but neither Arti nor I wanted to
      do more than the 10-footer.  Marina and Naomi need functioning parents more
      than we need a thrill like that!  We spent some time jumping off the rocks and
      swimming in the refreshing fresh water.  It was a really beautiful place, complete
      with a Gold-Billed Heron in a nest just above the 40-foot falls.\r\n\r\nArti
      jumps into the pool:\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/drrqkJAO1p4\"
      frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nWe swam as much as we wanted,
      then hiked back to the ATVs to get some lunch in Montezuma.  Pablo found a place
      for us that overlooked the ocean, and we had some good Costa Rican <i>Casado</i>
      (rice/beans plate).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://360.io/6Ma4BU\">Click to view a
      panorama</a> of the largest ficus tree in the world, and winner of the 2009
      Tree of the Year award.\r\n\r\nAnd <a href=\"http://360.io/rLwbbz\">here is
      another panorama</a> from a bridge we rode across on the way back.\r\n\r\nBack
      to the hotel, and we parted ways with Pablo for the final time.  He was such
      an excellent guide and host.  His knowledge of the local culture, plants, animals,
      and willingness to show folks like us around was very much appreciated.  We
      exchanged email addresses, and I sincerely hope we cross paths again.  He sped
      off to prepare for a private dinner he was cooking for that night.  His true
      passion is gastronomy, and after he gets his Masters degree in Archaeology,
      he is going to go to culinary school in Italy, hoping to return to Costa Rica
      to use his skills to make uniquely Costa Rican food using plants that are indigenous
      to the area.\r\n\r\nThursday afternoon, we sulked around by the pool for a while,
      sad that our vacation was winding down.  However, we had our special dinner
      to look forward to.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://360.io/rbBKRG\">Here's a panorama
      of the pool area at Flor Blanca</a>.\r\n\r\nWe got cleaned up in the room, and
      then went down to the pool/dinner area to see the staff had set up the \"dojo\"
      for us to eat in.  This is a covered platform above one side of the pool where
      there are normally a couple of couches.  This is where we were going to enjoy
      Spencer and Billy's creations for us.\r\n\r\nThe meal started with a caprese
      \"shooter\", then a salad with lettuce, a bit of basil, and a couple of gorgonzola-stuffed
      mushrooms to top it off.  The next course was a succotash of asparagus, olives,
      and other winter veggies in a phenomenal red wine reduction.  The main course
      was a panko-stuffed tomato along side some tasty veggie orzo.  Dessert was a
      molten chocolate cake in a ramican with a small scoop of coffee ice cream on
      the side.\r\n\r\nIt was great that the chefs at Flor Blanca would make such
      a special meal for us.  This is really a great example of the level of service
      we received all around there. \r\n\r\n<h3>Friday</h3>\r\nWe took a quick final
      walk on the beach before breakfast Friday.  After we ate, it was time to pack
      up and be ready for our 9:30a car ride to the airport.  We got to Tambor airport
      with plenty of time to spare, so we checked in (comprised of stepping on a scale
      and paying the $2.25 airport tax), and waited for our plane to arrive.\r\n\r\nWe
      rode in a Cessna Caravan from Tambor back to San Jose.  We had three hours between
      those flights, so we took a taxi in to the city center for some souvenir shopping.
      \ We got back to the airport to see that our flight was delayed a bit, which
      made us a little nervous since we had only an hour in Houston to go through
      customs, get our bags, and re-check them on the flight to San Francisco.  It
      ended up not being a problem at all ... we did all that in Houston in less than
      30 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe flight back to San Francisco was delayed about an hour,
      which combined with arriving at 12:30a PT (2:30a CT) made it feel pretty long.
      \ Driving home from the airport was a big test in stamina, since we had been
      traveling for the extent of the day.  "

    excerpt: Thursday took us on a zip line tour, a waterfall hike, some pool time,
      and a special dinner from the Flor Blanca chefs.  We took one last walk up the
      beach on Friday, then came back home.
