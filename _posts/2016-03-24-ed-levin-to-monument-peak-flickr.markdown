      Tim, Nina, and I took to the hills of Ed Levin Park for a quick loop in the evening. We kept a nice easy pace the whole way, which is a welcome change from my usual hammer time out there.

      There were tons of cows grazing near the trails this evening, but our mini-herd of humans was enough to get them to clear out in a hurry.

      We had a good time sprinting up the &quot;Monument Peak Vortex&quot; for some personal best times on that short section at the top of the hill.
