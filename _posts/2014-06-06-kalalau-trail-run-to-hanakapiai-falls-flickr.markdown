    description: "We drove to the end of the Kuhio Highway this morning. Arti and
      the girls played at Ke'e Beach while I took off on the Kalalau Trail to run
      up to Hanakapiai Falls, 8 miles round trip climbing 3600 feet along the way.\n\nIt
      was another really fun, challenging, and technical run.  It rained on and off
      all night, so the trail was really muddy, with streams and pools of water along
      the way.  Even without the mud, the trail goes over many stream crossings, boulder
      fields, and scrambles to keep things interesting.\n\nThe waterfall at the end
      was pretty spectacular, falling down a cliff about 500 feet high.\n\nThe run
      back was great, despite the trail being pretty busy.  I managed to help a bunch
      of people across streams and technical sections, which is a lot of fun in a
      boy scout sort of way :).\n\nThe girls were ready to pack up once I got back
      to Ke'e beach, so the timing worked out really well! \n\n<iframe height='405'
