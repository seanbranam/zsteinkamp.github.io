Starting in late Feb 2022, I will be looking for a new job. Writing my criteria serves as both a clarification exercise for me and for future employees/colleagues/referrals.

I have 25+ years of experience in the Internet applications space, with that time split between IC and management positions. I have worked in all layers of the stack in [many very different roles](/resume/) in many different languages and frameworks.

The moments that I am most proud of are when my work results in a multiplicitave or exponential improvement in capabilities for my team / org / product / systems. I love to blend creativity and engineering discipline, bringing new ideas or connecting people and systems in new ways to unlock new possibilities.

My dream job would allow me to use everything I have learned over the years to develop new worlds of success and efficiency in a product or orgzniation.

## Role

* Staff/Principal/Distinguished level individual contributor software engineer / architect
* Clear connection to company or organizational success
* Top-to-bottom responsibility in a given problem space
* Mentorship expected / encouraged
* Hands-on - solutioning / writing code >= 50% of the time
* Involved in determining team/org strategy and standards
* Involved in hiring and eventually hiring process

## Team Attributes

* A+ Teammates
  * Engaged - interested in team strategy and bring ideas for improvement
  * Diverse - role, skills, background, purpose
  * Growth Mindset
* Empowered - org/company support for optimizing for innovation
* Sensible positioning, not a duplicate

## Company / Org Attributes

* Not ad-revenue supported (e.g. SaaS or a paid product)
* Proven growth path
* High product standards
* Customer focus
* Respectable, inspiring leadership
* Demonstrated attention to employee growth and wellbeing
* High-responsibility environment (i.e. coordinated autonomy + low process overhead)

I'd appreciate feedback from people that I've worked with/for -- am I aiming too high? too low? anything to add? to remove? <a href="mailto:zack@steinkamp.us">zack@steinkamp.us</a>

Maybe you want to see my [resume](/resume/)?
