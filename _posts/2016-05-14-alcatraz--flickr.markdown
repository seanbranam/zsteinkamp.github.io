      As a work anniversary gift, Hoopla gives its employees an allowance toward a Blueboard.com gift. <a href="https://www.blueboard.com/">Blueboard is an experiential concierge service</a>, so they work with you to put together a fun day from a wide range of choices. Working with them was a real pleasure, and I highly recommend their service.

      I had been talking with the girls about taking them on a trip to Alcatraz, so here was a great opportunity to have Blueboard purchase the tickets for me and set up reservations for a nice meal.

      We packed a small lunch and took BART from Fremont to Embarcadero station, then walked to Pier 33. We took our time and still got there with plenty of time to get a snack.

      The ferry ride to Alcatraz is pretty short. The word &quot;bored&quot; was never uttered by either of the girls.

      We chose to just explore the island on our own time, which was super fun. We wandered looking at the beautiful flowers and surprising bird life. There were gulls and cormorants nesting on the ground, and white herons nesting in trees only a few feet from the roads and paths.

      There were textures and colors everywhere. We had a great time, each of us armed with a camera, getting creative with our shots.

      It was really interesting to learn about Alcatraz's history first as a fortress, then a prison, then a site for Native Americans to protest their treatment by the US government. Evidence of all of these past lives is still present there.

      Inside the prison, the girls were both kind of weirded out by the inside of the prison, especially the cells. Pretty sure they'll lead a life far away from crime as a result.

      We were all pretty tired after walking around for two and a half hours, so we took the 4:15pm ferry back to San Francisco.

      Our favorite vegetarian Chinese restaurant Enjoy was less than a mile away, so we headed that way for an early-ish dinner. This was a loooooong walk for us all. Naomi got to ride on my shoulders for the last quarter mile. But once we got there, dinner was delicious as always. The fake meat is a real novelty for the girls.

      We made our way back to the Embarcadero and stopped off at Over The Moon for a treat. They make some amazing ice cream and serve it on cookies they make. Marina had honey lavender ice cream between two snickerdoodles, and Naomi had caramel cookie dough in a chocolate chip cookie bowl. Both were really really good.

      It was an easy ride back to the Fremont BART station, then a drive home and straight to bed.

      Naomi summed up the day just right: &quot;Awesome and exhausting.&quot; Yep.
