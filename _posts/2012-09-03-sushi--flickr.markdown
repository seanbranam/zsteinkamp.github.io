    description: 'We made one of our favorites for dinner tonight.  It''s super easy,
      especially since you can prep pretty much everything way in advance.  Surprise
      new favorite ingredients: fried garlic slices, shiitakes sautÃ©ed in rice vinegar
      and soy sauce, and crushed wasabi peas.'
