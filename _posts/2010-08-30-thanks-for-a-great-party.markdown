Thanks to all who came on Saturday to our house for
our birthday get-together.  

It's always a great time to have the place filled up
with friends -- everything just works out.

Pauly and Ghizal drove up from San Diego/LA for the
event.  you guys are good at breaking out of your
comfort zones.
Em, Mark, and Ruby came up for a Waechtler party in
Cupertino, and came with Mimi and Pop earlier in the
day.  

Derek also was an early arrival -- good times.

We'll have to do more of this stuff.  Next time will
be an outside-in-the-evening party once it really
heats up.
