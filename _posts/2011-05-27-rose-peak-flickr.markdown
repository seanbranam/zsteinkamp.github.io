    description: I walked from Sunol Regional Park to the top of Rose Peak and back,
      which is about 20 miles round trip.  Rose Peak is the highest accessible point
      in Alameda County at about 3800 feet.  The trail was not particularly strenous,
      just LONG!   <a href='http://goo.gl/maps/qRPc'>Map Here</a>.<center><iframe
