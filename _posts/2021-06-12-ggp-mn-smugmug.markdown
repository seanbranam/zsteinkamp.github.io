    description: The girls and I skated for 5 miles in Golden Gate Park to check out the windmills, bison, bike track, and other cool sights in the mellow western side of San Francisco. We stopped for an awesome lunch at the Beach Chalet, then rode at Potrero Skatepark before heading back home. Really fun day.
