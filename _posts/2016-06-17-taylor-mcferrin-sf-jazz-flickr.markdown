    title: Taylor McFerrin SF Jazz
    description: I went with some friends to SF for an evening of good food and music.
      We started at Dirty Habit for creative drinks and plates, then on to the SF
      Jazz Center to see Taylor McFerrin perform. It was a very intimate setting,
      with room for about 60-75 people. His famous dad, Bobby, was in attendance.
      Taylor did a lot of improvisation and created most of the tracks on the spot,
      layer by layer. He invited a friend of his from the audience on stage to improvise
      a song together. They once performed as the Hart Foundation, with Taylor on
      the keyboard and beats and his friend on vocals. The one hour set flew by, with
      Taylor's many styles and talents showcased -- including beatboxing while playing
      the keyboard. Afterward we all agreed that we should have been up and dancing
      for most of the set!
