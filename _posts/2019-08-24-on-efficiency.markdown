    title: On Efficiency
---
As a software development team, we should be relentness in our pursuit of
efficiency. Not only in our algorithms, but more importantly in how our
team gets work done.

## Efficiency
Let's first clarify this concept. What do we mean by 'efficiency' in this
context? The simple definition of efficiency is the amount of output for a
given amount of input. In the context of a commercial software development team, the input is the
amount of time the people in the team give to their jobs, and the output is the amount of
value that team delivers to their business.

Any team activity that is not directly contributing to shipping value is
friction in the system. Some frictions are necessary (e.g.  the friction of a
bearing in an electric motor providing a guiding force to keep the motor
spinning precisely on a given axis), and some frictions are unnecessary (e.g. a
malfunctioning brake system that engages the brakes of a car all the time, slowing it down).

Sometimes an improvement in efficiency can be made by changing the design of a
system. By transitioning from steam power to gasoline power, automobiles became
more efficient. By transitioning from gasoline to electric, cars have became even
more efficient. Similarly, a team who is at maximum efficiency within the
constraints of one system of working may be more or less efficient in a
different system of working.

Our jobs as members of a team are to maintain a vigilance of skepticism for how
the team operates. What worked yesterday may not work today. Tomorow may bring
new learning or innovation that brings us toward better efficiency. It is our
job to identify these opportunities to improve efficiency and act on them.
