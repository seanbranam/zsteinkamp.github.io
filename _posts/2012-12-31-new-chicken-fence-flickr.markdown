      The chickens got really good at escaping from their "corner of paradise", and would make a mess of the rest of the yard.  On the advice of the nice folks at the local farm supply store, I tried a new kind of fence.

      It's made from 4'x4' PVC squares with chicken wire zip-tied to it.  They're anchored to the ground with 6' rebar sections pounded 3' deep.  A "T" fitting on each square allows the square to slip over the rebar, and the squares are zip-tied to one another.  It makes for a really sturdy setup.

      So far so good, with no escapees yet today.
