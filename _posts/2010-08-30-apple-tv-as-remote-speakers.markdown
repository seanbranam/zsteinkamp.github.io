I didn't see any mention of this in the news stories about the new Apple TV software or on Apple's site, but I noticed it today.

iTunes now lists Apple TV as a remote audio device, ala AirTunes.  This is really nice, since you can now play music through your home stereo, but controlled via the iTunes interface rather than using the Apple TV on-screen interface.  Me likey!
