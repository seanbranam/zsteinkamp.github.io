    description: Becca showed us another of her favorite runs today. This was a 5.6
      mile out-around-a-lake-and-back to Fragrance Lake, named after the common local
      Skunk Cabbage that gives the area a distinctive smell certain times of the year.
      It was a great run, with awesome terrain and scenery. The only downer was an
      angry wasp that bit my arm twice!
