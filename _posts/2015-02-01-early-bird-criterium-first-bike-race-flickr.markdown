    title: Early Bird Criterium - First Bike Race
    description: |-
      After getting a road bike last week and climbing Mt. Hamilton with Richie, David, and Ruslan, I thought it would be fun to try out racing. Ruslan is an avid racer and pointed me to ncnca.org, which has a comprehensive schedule of events.

      Lucky me, there was a racing clinic this weekend followed by a criterium race!

      In the clinic, we dove right in to practicing riding in a very tight pack - touching elbows at times, then riding in a tight three-wide fomation, then a rolling paceline, and finally in single file. This lasted about 45 minutes, then we had a debrief, a few minutes break, then off to the criterium.

      A bicycle criterium is a road race of several laps around a closed-off course. In this case, it was a 40 minute race in an industrial area of Fremont, which made for 11 laps around the 2.x mile course. I raced in the &quot;Cat 5 Men's 30-44&quot; group. Cat 5 is the least experienced of all bike racing groups, which was perfect for me.

      It was a big thrill to be riding in a pack, learning all about the huge advantage of drafting. Despite losing the draft in several places, I managed to stay with the lead pack and finished around midpack.

      Fellow rider Gary Cruz put together this amazing video of the race: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq39wqdk2CM">www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq39wqdk2CM</a> You can see me briefly take the lead at 13:20 :)

      I'm looking forward to the next one!
