    description: "We got up at 6:30 for an early breakfast so we could be on the way
      to the Cabo Blanco nature preserve by 7am.  After bagels, fresh fruit, and coffee,
      we met up with our guy Pablo in the hotel parking lot.  We were to ride an ATV
      about 40 minutes to Cabo Blanco where we would hike.  He explained how the ATV
      worked (5sp semi-automatic with reverse!) and we were off!  Riding the ATV was
      a lot of fun - probably the 2nd best way around Costa Rica's varied terrain.
      \ A motorcycle seems to be the best way to get around.  \r\n\r\nWe arrived at
      the reserve, paid the $10/person admission to a jolly guy, and we started outlet
      hike.  Pablo has studied biology and anthropology so he is an excellent resource
      for plants and animals.  He was very patient with us, and many times led us
      off the trail to observe interesting trees or animal behavior.  One notable
      case was when we got to hear the call and see the elaborate competitive mating
      dance of the Long Tail Manakin (TolÃ©do).  We also watched a Pale Billed Woodpecker
      fairly close knock on a tree then peer sideways at it to see if it had scared
      any worms out.  He is an expert in the local life, and helped us to experience
      and understand it to the fullest.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://360.io/wULCum\">Here
      is a 360-degree panoramas from the walk</a>.  <a href=\"http://360.io/PXCumK\">And
      another</a>.\r\n\r\nAs our four mile walk came to an end, the topic of lunch
      came up.  Given that we rode through a few small towns, it seemed to me that
      we could find a great typical Costa Rican \"soda\" to stop to eat.  Pablo asked
      us what we wanted to eat, and I told him that some traditional rice, beans,
      and plantains would hit the spot.  His eyes lit up as the idea came to him to
      share a place that he was very familiar with to us.  He explained to us that
      this place has been run by the same woman for decades, has no menu, and the
      rice and beans taste just like his grandmother would make.  Say no more!  I
      was sold.  \r\n\r\nWe arrived at the nondescript restaurant and were greeted
      by la seÃ±ora herself.  Pablo explained what we were in the mood for, and she
      set off to make us lunch.  She told us about the pickles and salsas she had
      made this week, and offered some special pickled chiles she had behind the counter.\r\n\r\nThe
      meal was better than I had hoped for.  Simple and delicious rice, beans, plantains,
      and a cabbage and beet slaw that cut it all perfectly.  Her salsas and pickles
      were the perfect accompaniment.  Not once did I long for a shot of the Costa
      Rican staple Lizano salsa.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this excellent meal, we thanked
      her as best we could in our meager Spanish, and I asked Pablo to relay the message
      to her that this was the best meal I have had in Costa Rica.  Her smile gave
      away that she was quite pleased with this.  She tirned to her friend and said
      quietly that she was happy that people still liked her food.  With all the foreign
      immigrants and tourists in the area, traditional Costa Rican cooking is becoming
      rare.\r\n\r\nWith happy bellies, we rode the ATV back to the hotel.  We thanked
      Pablo, who we would spend Thursday with again on another tour.\r\n\r\nAfter
      a short rest, we headed down to the beach.  Arti did sim sunny reading and I
      played in the waves for an hour or so.  We got some cold drinks then cappuccinos
      back at the hotel bar, then showered and got ready for dinner.\r\n\r\nWe took
      a cab to a well known restaurant in the area called Brisas Del Mar.  It's high
      on a hill overlooking the ocean.  We got there just as the sky started to change
      color with the sunset.  It was a delicious meal, and we met a very nice couple
      from Montana who were celebrating their final night in Costa Rica.  We ate as
      the sun set.  After dinner we walked around that part of town a bit and did
      some grocery shopping (Lizano, chocolate, and lollipops for the girls) then
      our taxi picked us up to go back to the hotel.\r\n\r\nWe talked to Spencer,
      our hotel's executive chef, about a special dinner for Thursday night.  He was
      excited to be put on a creative mission, and we're excited about what he will
      come up with!"

    excerpt: On Wednesday, we rode the ATV to Cabo Blanco Nature Reserve and had a
      great hike with Pablo along with a memorable lunch.  In the evening we enjoyed
      the sunset with dinner at Brisas Del Mar.
