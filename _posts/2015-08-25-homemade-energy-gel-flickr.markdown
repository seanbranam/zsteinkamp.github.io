      I spend a lot of money on energy gels. Each packet costs $1.25-$2.00 and contains 1-1.5 oz of gel. On a long run, I may consume as many as 6 gels. Over time, that adds up!

      I have gotten to know the kinds of food and nutrition I need while running, and none of the current gels deliver what I think is the right balance for me. I do well with a combination of complex and simple sugars, and do better with some electrolytes along the way versus taking capsules at long intervals. I don't know of a premade gel that fits what I think I need, so I decided to make my own!

      I found a basic recipe online, and have used that as a starting point. Here it is:

      <ul>
      <li>1c Maltodextrin Powder (I used &quot;Carbo Gain&quot;)</li>
      <li>1/2c Water</li>
      <li>2/3c Honey</li>
      <li>1/2t Salt</li>
      <li>1/2t Potassium-based Salt Substitute (I used &quot;Nu Salt&quot;)</li>
      </ul>

      Put it all in a pan and whisk over low heat until it's well mixed. Let it cool, then you're done!

      It makes 1.5 cups of gel, or the equivalent of 12 gel packets. The cost of these materials is $4.50, which works out to less than 40 cents per virtual packet.

      Each serving has 110 calories, 100mg of sodium, and 125mg of potassium. It has a buttery flavor, and is sweet but not nearly as sweet as a product like Honey Stinger gels.

      You can add protein powder or different flavorings to the mix depending on how you feel or what you want.

      For transport and consumption, Hammer Nutrition makes a product called a Gel Flask which can hold 4-5 servings of gel. It fits in my pocket or in a pocket in my hydration vest to carry with me on runs or rides.

      Go forth and consume!
