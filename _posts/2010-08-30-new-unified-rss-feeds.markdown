Today, I wrote a little bit of code to combine stories, photos, and videos into a single RSS feed.

Previously, there was a feed for stories and a feed for pictures.  With Marina, driving events, the DV Cam, our Macs, and iMovie HD, we've been making and sharing lots of videos.  I thought about making a feed just for videos, but that seemed like a worse solution than just rolling a single feed.

So from now going forward, there is just a single feed from the Nobot.  The old photos feed will still work for a long while, but you only need to subscribe to:
<pre>
<a href='http://thenobot.org/rss.php'>http://thenobot.org/rss.php</a>
</pre>

Ok, that's all for me.  Back to the fun...
