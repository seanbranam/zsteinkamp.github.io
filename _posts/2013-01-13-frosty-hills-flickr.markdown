      My first official training run for the Ohlone 50K took me from Ed Levin County Park, up to Monument Peak, then past Mt. Allison, up and over Mission Peak, turned around and did it all in reverse.  It was just shy of 13 miles and took about 2h45m.  Total ascent was 3400 feet.

      At 8:30a, when I drove past the bank in Milpitas the sign said 33 degrees.  There were traces of frost/ice/snow once I got to around 2K feet.  Along the ridge the wind was really blowing, so I was glad to have worn gloves, but was wishing for something on my face/ears!

      All in all it was yet another unique time out there in the hills.  I can't get enough of those trails!
