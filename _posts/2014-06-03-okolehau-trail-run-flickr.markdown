      The Okolehau Trail runs along a ridge above Hanalei Bay.  It is fairly steep for the first 2 miles, then it gets crazy steep -- with a series of 30 ropes to use to climb some nearly vertical sections.

      It had rained 1.5&quot; yesterday, so the trail was very slick and muddy.  Just getting up the first part was a challenge.  After I climbed up one rope, I wasn't feeling like it was a great idea to continue on, so I cut it short and ran back to the house.

      I'd love to go back on a drier day.  I think it would be even more fun and challenging!
