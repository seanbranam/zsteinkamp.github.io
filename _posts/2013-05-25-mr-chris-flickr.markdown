    description: "Mr. Chris is the newest member of our family.  He's five years old,
      and was rescued as a kitten. \n\nHe was pretty nervous when Joanne of the 13th
      Street Cat Rescue brought him over, but after a couple of hours alone, the girls
      went in to pet him and he was purring away.\n\nHe's had a couple of unsuccessful
      attempts with foster homes, but we think our place will work out for him."
