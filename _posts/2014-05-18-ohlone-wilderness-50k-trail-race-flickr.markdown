    description: "It was a fantastic day for the O50K run.  Great weather, excellent
      aid stations, and better preparation than last year led to a finishing time
      that I was really happy with.  \n\nArti and the girls dropped me off at the
      Mission Peak trailhead in Fremont at around 7:30am.  The busses that brought
      most of the other runners from Del Valle had already arrived, but the registration
      line was short. I checked in, got my number, and then milled about finding the
      handful of folks I knew.  MarkF and Zombie Christopher were running Ohlone for
      the first time, JerryR was running it for the 18th time, and JohnnyB, who I
      finally met face-to-face, was looking to improve on his 2nd place finish from
      last year.  The crowd seemed pretty relaxed this time... or maybe it was just
      me.\n\nHaving accomplished my goal of finishing the race last year, I decided
      I'd put a little more into it this year.  My fitness had been improving all
      year, particularly since January.  I lost 10 more pounds, stabilizing at or
      below 180 for the last 6 months -- this is more than 30 fewer pounds than my
      peak weight from 4 years ago.  Arti has inspired me to push harder in my workouts
      and it's paid off.  I've had a string of PRs throughout the year on all of my
      usual trails, and I've really gotten to know what my body needs nutrition-wise
      while running for a long time.  My strategy last year was \"walk anything but
      downhills\".  This year it was \"run anything but steep uphills\".\n\nMy fueling
      strategy was to refill my 100oz water bladder twice -- once at Sunol (mile 9.5)
      and once at Maggie's Half Acre (mile 21).  I brought enough sugary stuff (Huma
      gels and Honey Stinger chews) for the whole race, but I'd grab at least one
      PB+J and/or potatoes from each of the 6 aid stations.  This would give me plenty
      of calories, and minimize stopped time at the aid stations for refilling water.\n\nAt
      8:00am sharp, the starting countdown reached zero, and the herd was off.  I
      started near the back of the pack, but had decided to jog to the first cattle
      guard for a bit of a warmup.  This got me past about half of the field, then
      it was shift to power hike most of the way up the Peak Trail, except for a couple
      places where it levels off.  Having run and hiked up these trails countless
      times, I was well prepared for how much effort I should spend in this first
      part.  I knew I probably wouldn't PR this opening climb, but I wanted it to
      be close.  I passed quite a few people on these first steep climbs, and so I
      was finding my position in the field.\n\nThe weirdest part of the race happened
      on my favorite part of this first climb.  It's where the \"Ohlone Extra Mile\"
      section of the course traverses one of the hills south of the peak to meet up
      with the Horse Heaven Trail again.  There are a few very small (6 feet across)
      swampy areas here, where water oozes out of the ground and makes some mud.  Since
      there wasn't much rain this year, there was only one of these mud bogs.  I had
      passed the bog several times in the weeks leading up to the race, so I knew
      what to expect.  As we approached it, there was a gentleman sitting just above
      the bog, mud up to his thighs, and no shoes.  He had an Ohlone 50K number on,
      running clothes, and a very defeated look on his face.  From what I understand,
      he had started early (this is an option) and misjudged the depth of the mud
      when he crossed and sunk in past his knees.  When some of the front-runners
      who started at the official time came upon him, they stopped to help.  At one
      point four or five people were trying to pull him out of the mud!  I'm not sure
      if he continued, but I doubt he was able to pull his shoes out.\n\nAfter another
      mile I got to the peak, then it was about 5 miles of downhill to Sunol.  I grabbed
      two PB&J at the Laurel Loop aid station -- eating one and putting the other
      in my shorts pocket for halfway down the hill.  My downhill form is less consistent
      than I'd like, and so downhill runs are hit-or-miss for me these days.  Some
      days I feel strong and in control going fast down hills, and others I feel heavy
      and clumsy, pounding the trail.  This was a medium-bad downhill day for me,
      so I kept it to a moderate pace to make sure I didn't clydesdale out.\n\nAt
      Sunol (mile 9.5) I felt warmed up and ready to tackle the last 2/3 of the race.
      \ Refilled water, grabbed some potatoes+salt and a couple PB&J, and set off
      for the 10 mile climb up to Rose Peak.  The trail starts off flat, then climbs
      fairly steeply for a couple miles, then descends about 500 feet to the Backpack
      Area (13 miles, another aid station, another PB&J), then climbs to Rose Peak.
      \ I had been drinking pretty steadily along the way, and so I decided to refill
      water at the Goat Rock aid station (16 miles) just to be safe.  I don't like
      to have to ration water unless it's necessary, and I wasn't 100% sure I'd make
      it another 5 miles on what I had.  I probably would have, but mind games are
      a powerful force in a race like this.\n\nIt was a bit less than an hour of hard
      climbing to get to Rose Peak.  The course circles the peak then heads to Maggie's
      Half Acre aid station (21 miles).  This was the most awesome aid station on
      the whole run!  Along with more PB&J and potatoes, they had fresh and COLD cantaloupe
      and strawberries.  Oh yes, this was AWESOME.  What a spirit lifter!\n\nThe course
      continues for the last 10 miles along steep rolling hills, some significant
      downhills, mixed with some unkind climbs, most notably at mile 27-28 where after
      a long descent, the trail ascends a ridge to gain about 500 feet in a mile.
      \ This isn't the steepest part of the race by a long shot, but at that point
      it feels like it.\n\nFrom here, it's all downhill to the finish.  I had been
      texting my position to Arti along the way so that she and the girls could meet
      me at the finish without waiting too long.  At mile 29 I send her the note \"2
      to go\".  She replied a few minutes later saying \"oh no, we are still 8 miles
      from Del Valle!\"  My heart sank.  Either she was playing with me, or I was
      in for a lonely finish, or she'd speed and make it just in time.  Regardless,
      I was not going to slow down.  I knew I was making great time so far, and I
      wanted to do as well as possible.\n\nOf course, Arti and the girls were right
      there cheering me on as I dropped out from the trees in the final chute.  I
      was running as fast as I could at that moment!  I swerved over to where they
      were to high-five them.  Then I looked at the timing display -- 6:43:xx as I
      crossed the finish line -- more than 90 minutes faster than last year!\n\nLarry
      England was there again to congratulate every finisher and give them their finisher
      wood plank and goodie bag.  This is a nice touch.\n\nAlong with some cold grapefruit
      soda, yogurt, and bagel with cream cheese, Arti and the girls brought a small
      tub and filled it with ice water so I could soak my feet.  Ahhhh!  This was
      an excellent surprise, and welcome relief for my poor toes.\n\nOverall I don't
      think the race could have gone smoother.  I was happy to be able to push myself
      to finish well vs. just finish.  I'm looking forward to Ohlone 2015 to see if
      I can do better than 6:30...\n\n<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0'

    excerpt: It was a fantastic day for the O50K run.  Great weather, excellent aid
      stations, and better preparation than last year led to a 6h43m finishing time
      -- more than an hour and a half better than last year.
