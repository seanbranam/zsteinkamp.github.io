    description: 9.5 mile hike in Ed Levin County Park.  I started on the Tularcitos
      trail, then took a right onto the Agua Caliente trail for a bit, then went off-trail
      up to the valley between Monument Peak and Mt. Allison.  Up and over Monument
      Peak and back down the hang gliding road (where the rattler was) and Tularcitos
      trail.

        a rattlesnake once it warmed up...
