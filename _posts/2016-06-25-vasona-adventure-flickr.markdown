    description: We've been talking for a couple weeks about renting a pedal boat
      and tooling around Vasona Lake. Well, today we lived the dream. I happily pedaled
      from a fairly compact position (non-adjustable seats and all) while the girls
      practiced &quot;accidentally falling&quot; into the water. It was a hot day,
      so the girls were on cloud nine. I was hoping we'd get tossed out of the lake
      due to all the shenanigans, but alas we made a full circuit of the lake under
      daddy-power. Happy to oblige, girls! After returning to land, we got a cold
      treat then went to play at one of the playgrounds, then to the creek running
      through the park. We heard someone playing the clarinet in the distance and
      went to investigate. Just our luck that there's a weekly summer concert program
      at Vasona and we were just in time to hear 'The Klezmakers' put on a Klezmer
      show. Awesome luck! We got hungry though and returned home to make dosas then
      watch Castle in the Sky. Fun day!
