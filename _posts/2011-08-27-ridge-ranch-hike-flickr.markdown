    description: 9.5 miles from Ohlone, straight up Mission Ridge at the first gate,
      up and over Mission Peak then off-trail up Mt. Allison.  Returned via the &quot;Ranch
      Trail&quot; which leads to Mill Creek Road, then picked up the Peak Trail back
      to Ohlone where the two come close together.
