    - description: Marina poses next to our original design -- a cardboard box, with
        pinpricked foil covering a hole in one end, projecting the sun onto a piece
        of paper on the other end.  It's like a pinhole camera.

    - description: If a pinhole camera could do it, one of the lenses we have at the
        house can do it.  After trying a magnifying glass, camera lenses forward and
        backward, the binoculars yielded the best result.

    description: The girls and I put together a little contraption to safely look
      at the eclipse.  It evolved into a slightly more complicated contraption as
      the moon moved along...
