      Achievement Unlocked!  This was the first time I ran up Mission Peak without stopping or walking.  It ended up being a minute slower than my prior &quot;run and fast walk combo&quot; ascent, but perhaps there is a future of more speed?

      I continued to Mt. Allison for the awesome view of MP from the south, then descended as it got dark.

      At the beginning of the fast part of the descent I barely caught up with another runner.  He was going fast, but I was a tiny bit faster in that section.  We exchanged greetings as I went by.  The trail got steeper, and I could hear him catching up.  I wasn't going to go any faster, so I told him &quot;go get it!&quot; and he disappeared down the hill in front of me.

      I caught up to him walking on the road back to the car.  We chatted for a bit about MP and running and O50K and went on our separate ways.
