    description: "I set out on my bike today from the Alviso Marina to go to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawbridge,_California\">Drawbridge,
      CA</a>.\n\nDrawbridge is a ghost town in the marshland between Alviso and Fremont.
      \ It was settled in 1876, and people lived there until 1979.  Now it's just
      a run-down, vandalized collection of structures along the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\n<iframe

      style=\"color:#0000FF;text-align:left\">Drawbridge</a> in a larger map</small>\n\nThe
      ride there was pretty muddy, and I had to walk (run) with my bike through the
      last mile or so along the train tracks.  \n\nAfter I had explored what I wanted
      to explore, I heard a train horn in the distance.  I froze.  It sounded again,
      this time louder.  I didn't want to get caught out there since I was either
      on Union Pacific land or off-limits of the East Bay Regional Park district,
      so I hid behind a concrete wall near the train bridge where the engineer couldn't
      see me.\n\nThe Amtrak train passed overhead with a powerful thundering force.
      \ I got some photos of it as it passed by.  One is in this set.\n\nI knew there
      wouldn't be another train for a while, so I hustled back to the safety of the
      trail and rode the few miles back to the car."
