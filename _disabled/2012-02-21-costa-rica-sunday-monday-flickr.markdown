    title: Costa Rica Sunday/Monday
    pub_date: '2012-02-20 08:47:37 -0800'
    description: "<h3>Sunday</h3>\nGetting to Costa Rica was an adventure in itself.
      \ Out flight to Houston left SFO at 12:30am PT, and arrived at around 6:30am
      CT.  The flight from Houston to San Jose, CR was scheduled to leave at 10:40am,
      which left us with four hours to kill in Houston.  We wandered around a bit,
      dodging to onslaught of electric people-moving carts (anyone who has been to
      IAH knows what I'm talking about...).  We passed by the United Club in the international
      terminal.  \"I wonder if we could get in there\", Arti wondered out loud as
      we passed by.  In a sleepy daze, we decided to check.  Turns out that since
      we had bought upgraded tickets (first class was surprisingly only a couple of
      hundred dollars more) we could get in to this exclusive place.  It was very
      nice inside - quiet, comfortable chairs, free breakfast, showers, the works.
      \ We slept for a bit, then had some bagels, yogurt, fruit and granola.  We popped
      out to the Starbucks down the way to get some coffee too.\n\nThe flight to San
      Jose was delayed a bit due to mechanical issues, which made us nervous for our
      next connection, but it worked out just fine.\n\nAfter landing in San Jose,
      we hopped in a cab for a 20 minute ride to a smaller airport where we would
      take a small plane to the Tambor Airport, located on the Nicoya Peninsula.  Riding
      in the single turboprop Cessna Caravan was my favorite part of thee journey
      there.  We sat right behind the pilots on this 15 passenger plane, which was
      a lot of fun.  It was a very smooth ride, and a thrilling landing, since the
      tiny airstrip is right on the beach.  Here's a video of the landing...\n\n<iframe
      width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/UW6FHj5iVYo\"
      frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nFrom Tambor, we rode in a car
      for about 45 minutes on paved and dirt roads until we got to the town on Santa
      Teresa and our hotel Flora Blanca.\n\nWe were welcomed with a fresh coconut
      with a straw inserted through a small hole in the top, and warm Costa Rican
      hospitality.  Fernando got our paperwork sorted out, the took us for a tour
      of the hotel grounds, the restaurant, yoga room, pool, spa, and our room.  The
      hotel has 9 villas on 7 beachfront acres.  It's pretty spectacular.\n\n<a href=\"http://360.io/JJx92H\">Click
      for a panorama from outside our villa</a>.\nAnd <a href=\"http://360.io/sD6EkT\">here
      is a panorama of the outdoor bathroom</a> which was more awesome than I imagined.\n\nWe
      relaxed in our room for a bit, exhausted after the 20 hours of traveling that
      started before midnight the day before.  After a bit of cleanup, we ventured
      out to the hotel restaurant for a late dinner.  The staff was so friendly and
      accommodated our vegetarianness with aplomb.  Billy the sous chef came out to
      talk with us about some options that were off the menu, and we ended up with
      a really delicious and special meal.\n\nOff to bed for 11 hours of sleep (!!!).
      \ \n\n<h3>Monday</h3>\nWe got up just before the 11am breakfast cutoff, and
      had some awesome Gallo Pinto (rice, beans, eggs, fresh fruit, and handmade corn
      tortillas).  There is this salsa in Costa Rica called Lizano that is so delicious
      on pretty much anything, and it was well represented here.\n\nWe then went back
      to the room and changed in to our swimming clothes and headed out to the beach
      for a little sun and water fun.  The water here is just right!  Not so hot that
      you get hot swimming, and not so cold that it takes any time to get used to.
      \ Very nice.  After a few hours, we went back for lunch, then talked with the
      hotel concierge about some options for our remaining days here.  Then we spent
      some time at the pool.   At 4:30, Arti went to get a massage, and I did some
      exploring north along the coast.\n\n<iframe width=640 height=480 src=\"http://360.io/43HB4U\"></iframe>\n\nWe
      had dinner at the hotel next door named Milarepa.  It's run by a French couple,
      and we had a nice salad, gaspacho, veggie risotto, and a delicious banana-filled
      crepe with a nice chocolate sauce on top.  We walked back to our hotel and got
      a couple of decaf cappuccinos and walked down to the beach to enjoy them under
      the amazing canopy of stars.  There are SO many stars visible here.  Really
      astounding."

    excerpt: We traveled to Costa Rica beginning at 12:30a PT on Sunday.  We arrived
      at our hotel that evening, had dinner, then hit the sack.  Monday was a lazy
      day of playing in the ocean, swimming in the pool, a massage for Arti and some
      exploring up the coast for me.
