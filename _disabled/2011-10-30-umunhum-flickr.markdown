      description: This is from the &quot;off trail&quot; portion of the hike.  Someone
        was kind enough to leave these to mark their route up.  Perhaps someone affiliated
        with the project to turn this area into a park?

    title: Umunhum
    pub_date: '2011-10-30 04:11:51 -0700'
    description: "I made it to the top of Mt. Umunhum (3500ft) today.  This mountain
      is known for \"The Box\" that sits atop it, which used to be the base of a large
      radar antenna operated by the Air Force from the 50s until the 80s.  There is
      a project underway to turn this area into a public park, starting with a huge
      cleanup effort to remove the lead, asbestos, and other nasties from the facility.\r\n\r\nMy
      last attempt to summit Umunhum was thwarted by the thought of hillbillies and
      methmakers who are rumored to live in the area, as my route took me out of the
      park and onto private roads.  After some careful planning on an alternate route
      that stayed 100% in the park land, I got a chance to try it today.  \r\n\r\nFrom
      Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve, take the Woods Rd trail for 2.7 miles.  Turn
      left at the Barlow Rd trail and go a mile or so.  Once you get to the \"spine\"
      of the mountain, turn right up the hill.  This is very steep and somewhat treacherous,
      but was a very beautiful part of the hike once I was out of the thick underbrush.\r\n\r\nYou
      can download a .gpx track of the route at http://steinkamp.us/umunhum.gpx\r\n\r\nUpdate
      2011-11-01: I got a mysterious email after posing this.  Check it out below:\r\n<blockquote
      style=\"padding:1em; border:1px solid #CCC; background:#eee;\">\r\nFrom: TheBoxOnTheHill
      theboxonthehill@gmail.com\r\n<br/>Subject: Illegal Hiking\r\n\r\nMr. Steinkamp,\r\n\r\nYour
      hiking on Mt. Umunhum was done illegally and this is to advise you that the
      appropriate authorities have been notified.\r\n\r\nThe entire mountain is off
      limits it o the public and not open to hiking, biking, or any other access for
      that matter.  You illegally trespassed on \"Closed Area\" and \"Hazardous Area\"
      property which is a misdemeanor citable offense.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.openspace.org/news/\r\nhttp://www.openspace.org/news/downloads/2011.07.22.MtUmClosedAreaMap.pdf\r\n\r\nNext
      time, READ THE SIGNS.  And don't claim any bullshit about \"there were none\".
      \ They're there and you know it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we notify your employer as well
      (as to what you're doing on your \"spare time\"...  trespassing)\r\n\r\nRemove
      the photos and your blog post and you might make things easier for you.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nVigilante
      park ranger?  Crazed hillbilly protecting his meth crop?  "
