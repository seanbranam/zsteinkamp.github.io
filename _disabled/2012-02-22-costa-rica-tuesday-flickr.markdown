    description: "We got up at about 6:45am to get ready and be at breakfast at 7am.
      \ Our itinerary for today was a stand-up paddle boarding lesson at 8am, then
      horseback riding at 2:30pm.\r\n\r\nWe watched this monkey family go from tree
      to tree while we were having breakfast:\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"
      src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/FRYATnAxhjQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nThe
      stand-up paddle boarding was a lot more fun than I expected!  Our teacher was
      Andy at Freedom SUP in Mal Pais.  He moved to CR from the San Diego area in
      1994.  His background is in surfboard design and shaping, and so he also makes
      surfboards for locals here.  We did a 20 minute \"ground school\" in the soccer
      field adjacent to the beach, then in the water we went.  It was pretty easy
      to pick up, and I only fell in the water a couple or five times.  Toward the
      end of our hour in the water I was feeling pretty comfortable.  Too bad the
      wind was pretty strong - we stayed close to the beach rather than traveling
      around the point to see some of the nature preserve at the southern tip of the
      peninsula.  \r\n\r\nAfter some relaxing, we had lunch, then more relaxing, then
      a short drive north to where we would ride some horses.  We started on a beach
      near Playa Hermosa.  Our guide Pablo was excellent, as was our guide-in-training
      Veronica.  We rode along the beach, then turned inland and rode up and down
      some amazing hills within a 500 acre cattle ranch.  \r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\"

      frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>(the squeaking was my saddle)\r\n\r\nWe
      saw many kinds of birds and fruit trees.  The horses were super well behaved
      and would respond to the slightest nudge, but at the same time would smartly
      choose a good path in the many areas we went through where there was no clear
      path.  We came to a little bar in the middle of nowhere (a crossroads between
      a few towns) and stopped for a soda and some time out of the saddle.  Back on
      the horses for the ride back, mostly on the beach, just in time to watch the
      sun set. An excellent experience that was better than I had hoped it would be!\r\n\r\nAfter
      getting back to the hotel, we cleaned up a bit then walked 500m or so down the
      road to a little Italian restaurant called Al Chile Viola.  We shared a nice
      salad, and ordered a potato ravioli dish in butter and sage, as well as a farfale
      with tomatoes and garlic.  Their pastas are made on site and were excellent.
      \ We finished the meal with a delicious banana brownie ala mode, then walked
      back to the hotel. "

    excerpt: In the morning on Tuesday, we took a stand-up paddleboard lesson (sorry,
      no photos) and then in the afternoon went horseback riding on the beach and
      up into the hills on a private ranch.  Dinner was at Al Chile Violet down the
      street.
