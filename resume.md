# About
I have been building web applications since 1995, and at mega-scale starting in 1999. My interest and experience through the years has been very broad -- frontend, backend, data infrastructure, networking, security, devops, visual design, usability, infrastructure, people management, hiring, and work flow optimization. I am currently seeking a position where I can work with an A+ team and apply all of these skills to help a promising company succeed.
