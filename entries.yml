We don't really mind the implied insult but we do wish it wasn't so bereft of anything remotely clever. However, it's hardly surprising considering the many spelling and grammar errors in your email. We've provided the correct usage so you can learn from your mistakes.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  1) \\\"I THINK IF EVERYONE WAS RAGING HOMOSEXUAL LIKE US WE COULD LIVE IN HARMONY WITH THE OCEANS...\\\" You need to include the determiner \\\"a\\\" in front of \\\"raging\\\". Also, you should really use \\\"then\\\" between \\\"us\\\" and \\\"we\\\".\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  2) \\\"... LETS NOT FORGET ABOUT THE FISHES...TOO\\\" Where's the apostrophe? The correct usage is \\\"let's\\\". It is a contraction of \\\"let\\\" and \\\"us\\\". Also, there should be a comma after fishes not \\\"...\\\"\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  3) \\\"I WOULD LIKE TO CREATE A NEW BRANCH THAT DEDICATED TO ANAL INFILITRATION AND WATER TITRATION.\\\" This is just sad. This sentence is the big payoff line in your email and you spelled \\\"infiltration\\\" wrong!! You also forgot to use the verb \\\"is\\\" between \\\"that\\\" and \\\"dedicated\\\". You could have used \\\"that's\\\" instead, but as we've seen earlier you don't have a good understanding of contractions. Using \\\"titration\\\" may have sounded funny to you because it contained the word \\\"tit\\\" (settle down, Beevis) but it doesn't really make sense in the context of your email. Read the definition below and see if you can understand what I mean.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  ti-tra-tion, noun: a method or the process of determining the concentration of a dissolved substance in terms of the smallest amount of a reagent of known concentration required to bring about a given effect in reaction with a known volume of the test solution; especially : the analytical process of successively adding from a burette measured amounts of a reagent to a known volume of a sample in solution or a known weight of a sample until a desired end point (as a color change) is reached.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  4) Try using proper upper and lower case usage. Although not really necessary for casual email usage it is more effective if you're really try to make a point.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  I hope this was helpful to you. We're looking forward to a new and improved insulting email from you in the future. Please try to make the next one funny if possible.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Thank you and have a nice day. You are so mercifully free from the ravages of intelligence. \"\n"

  data: "--- \n:excerpt: \"\"\n:title: The Abe Cantina Scene, Featuring Harris Solo\n:content: |-\n  Gentlemen,\n  \n  I too have been preoccupied with filling my time by moving seemingly random pieces of paper from one location on my desk to another, in a vain effort to appear as though I am earning my paycheck. However, I feel that sufficient time has passed in order to justify recounting another Sushi Adventure(c).\n  \n  Now I'm not a psychologist, I only play one on TV. However, I would have loved to have taken anyone with a Ph.D. in Psych, with an emphasis in bi-polar disorders to suss out the reasoning behind two individuals' behavior one night last week, in my favorite sushi bar, Abe (pronounced \"AH'-bay\") in Newport Beach. Just as a point of reference, if Sushi Wave is a \"5\" on a scale of one to ten, then Abe is a \"10\" (food and decor rating, not clientele as you will read...).\n  \n  The Build-Up:\n  \n  It was a Friday night on the Newport Peninsula, replete with all its usual and customary offerings (i.e., scantily-clad, bleached-blonde Social Ecology majors from UCI, meathead Sigma Chis, and me without a shotgun or a scalpel). The ides of October were upon me, and as such the weather had a crispness to it that was reminiscent of jack o'lanterns, apple festivals and Maker's Mark (in a bucket, on the rocks, please). It's Bourbon season, lads and I don't mean hunting French aristocrats. After a long Friday at work, three glasses of a beautiful 1995 Cain Cuvee (wonderful nose, sassy but never precocious, complex concentrated cassis and black currant flavors framed by herbs and toasty oak, excellent paired with venison. A 91 from Wine Spectator.), and a pair of Dunhill Reds, I felt a craving for aquatic food. Perhaps it was my Irish-Catholic upbringing or just my proximity to the harbor, but nonetheless, the evening called for seafood. I was clothed comfortably in a cashmere-and-cotton blend roll-collar sweater in black, \"dirty\" blue jeans, both by DKNY. My shoes, polished calf-skin boots by Kenneth Cole. I started up the Spyder, put the top down and made my way down to PCH.\n  \n  As I made it onto the Peninsula, I was welcomed by an unusually heavy blast of red brake-lights and it was apparent that there was a particularly base electricity in the air. Chalk it up to all of the raised Chevy Suburbans, Ford F150s, and GMC Tahoes, or attribute it to the females in various Korean-manufactured automobiles listening to such various and sundry aural offerings as 'Who Let the Dogs Out', by The Baha Men, and/or Korn's perennial favorite, \"Faggot\". Suffice it to say, I knew I would likely be in for a surprise as soon as I walked in the door at Abe. Upon my entrance to the restaurant, I was greeted with a bold, \"Ira-shei\", and immediately whisked to a single spot awaiting me at the bar. I ordered my usual triumverate of liquid accoutrements: a tall Sapporo, hot green tea and an ice water. My steamed towel came shortly thereafter. My favorite chef and the proprietor, Abe was of course, working my section and I asked him to begin. My first course was seared yellowtail with sliced jalepenos and a delightful ponzu sauce. Abe apologized for making me wait and ordered a bottle of Hakkugin (complex variety of essences, bold and flavorful) for us to share. With a hearty \"Kampai\" and a toss of the head, we were each down one shot. For a Friday night spent solo, this was turning out just right. I was flanked by the buxom girlfriend/mistress/ex-wife of two apparent witness protection program participants, not quite of Henry Hill's ilk. But I could deal, mainly because they were reasonably out of earshot of their respective male counterparts. Frankly, I was beginning to think that I was actually going to have an experience in a sushi bar that did not involve my expensive clothes getting ruined or especially any personal space violation. {Sigh} Yeah right.\n  \n  The Elephant Walk:\n  \n  As I mentioned, it was a particularly busy Newport night. In fact, I was fortunate to have happened along just as a singular seat was being vacated, presumably by an individual much like myself, flying solo by choice, not happenstance. As I finished the last delectable bite of my second course, a Matsutake Dobimishu with some exotic Japanese citrus, the pair of bon-vivantes to my right stood up to leave, clearing my peripheral path to reveal what I estimate to be a four-hundred-pound behemoth of a man and his Brobdingnagian mother. {Sigh}. Part of my constitution is to plan for the worst and hope for the best, at least that's what Mom taught me to do. How the hell was I supposed to plan for this? In terms of dimensions, the man must have occupied at least three-and-a-half feet in horizontal space! His mother, proportionately embonpoint, took up approx. three feet in horizontal space. Real estate, as expensive as it is in Newport, allows for no more than four feet for two seats at the bar. These guys are smart though, they'll wait for a third person in series to leave and then remove the extra chair so that everyone can eat in comfort. Nope.\n  \n  Gog and Magog:\n  \n  In comes Fat Bastard and Mommy Dearest. If there is a blessing to be counted regarding this situation, it is that the man did not sit in the seat right next to me, his mother did. However, prior to taking her seat, (which I later discovered, entailed placing her Wal-Mart-leggings-wrapped, triple-digit-body-fat-percentage thigh on my right leg) she inquired in a thick Kentucky accent, \"They're about to leave (gesturing to the couple of Structure-shoppers to my left), would you mah-nd scootin' dahn just a skoash?\" I sighed and thought, \"Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?\", while I moved into the last possible half-inch of personal space to my left, resulting in the subsequent touching leg-to-leg, elbow-to-elbow of the party on either side of me, the least of all comfortable dining situations. Mommy Fattest proceeded to make what appeared to be a thick wasabe-and-soy-sauce wassail out of her serving board condiments. The woman ran everything that was placed in front of her in the Soilent-Green, i.e. ginger, eda-mame, and what I found to be the most repulsive thing that I have borne witness to in the last four years, HER STEAMED TOWEL.\n  \n  OK, I thought, while certainly strange and obviously outside the box of Ms. Manners-approved etiquette, I just won't look. Right. Have you ever walked past an X-rated movie or seen a car crash? It's not going to happen. The woman began to orally cull the soy-and-wasabe-succulence from her towel. I developed a look on my face that could only convey absolute disgust and further, telegraph impending regurgitation of fish, exotic Japanese mushroom soup and steamed soybeans. The sushi chefs in aggregate had the same look on their faces and were speaking hurriedly in Japanese, presumably only about our friend who forgot her L-Dopa supplement. At this point, the concocted serum du soy had spilt on the counter, in her lap and was slowly making its way to my side of the ever-decreasing world. I could not help but to empathize with the inhabitants of Pompeii eighteen-hundred years ago, as so many tons of hot lava from Mt. Vesuvius came encroaching on their sleepy, docile world. All the time, she was speaking in her West-Kentucky vernacular about family members and their respective fried-chicken recipes. I felt as though I had had my fill of sushi for one evening, and before I began to wretch, I asked for my tab and cleared it with my Platinum card. I was reminded of the Millenium Falcon making its way out of the exploding Death Star, with no time to spare. I drove home with crinkled brow and questioning mind as I planned to write my friends about my latest experience in that General Population known as Sushi.\n  \n  Adieu, until next time...\n"

  data: "--- \n:excerpt: \"\"\n:title: Sushi lunch with Earl, Doug, et. al.\n:content: |-\n  Gents:\n  \n  As I went to my usual Thursday 'spot-du-dejeuner\", Sushi Wave in Costa Mesa, I was filled with a wonderful air of hope. First, it's Thursday, the week is nearly over and it's almost time to let loose with a couple of Miller High Lives on the week-end. Second, I have a bit of a sore throat (maybe it's that \"seein' to\" I gave to the Brother who works the door at Buzz in Lido, I don't know), and I was looking forward to some green tea and miso soup to make Campbell's soup turn away in its inability to comfort me in my time of need. Sorry, it was time to move on. Contributing tertiarily to my hope content was the promise of some enchanting eye-candy to take more than a cursory look at across the sushi bar from me as I eat the heads of my prey, the ever-feared Ama-Ebi.\n  \n  Enter The Dragon\n  \n  Work with me here, as I attempt to paint a picture of the only individuals capable of ruining my usual Savantesque drive to enjoy raw fish on a Thursday afternoon. I walk in to the bar and the place is packed. It's seeping with clam, and I don't just mean the mirugai, my friends. Now, I'm as tolerant of the testosterone-laden comments and increases in volume/pitch that are deemed necessary by those male individuals who, 30 years prior, pitched no-hitters and injected their arses with unique chemical compounds such as Dyanabol or Winstrol so that they could get an extra 250 lbs. of weight off the ground while performing squats, as the next guy who chooses not to act that way (which is not tolerant in the least). I can even handle the accompanying \"High-Fives\" that inevitably follow a beer. Enter four, middle-aged, corpulent, sack-suit-saddled, Collections Department middle-managers with an afternoon to kill between pinching the admin's ass and catching UPN's discussion of (WWF) The Rock's latest best-seller at 6:00 PST. They proceed to sit themselves \"around\" their chairs, as I don't believe that semantically, the word \"on\" would be appropriate application herein, since these fellows' collective ass-weight would exceed a tare weight of approx. 3 metric tonnes. The first of these four individuals proceeds to rattle off his alcoholic beverage order for the group. \"Gimme four Kai-rin I-CHI-ban and two big bottles o' HOT SAW-ke!!!\", he yells across the restaurant, a la Nicholson in \"As Good As It Gets\". I knew right then that I was in for a real treat with these Gyrovagi. He then turns to the sushi chef/proprietor and yells to him (mind you, he is a maximum of THREE (3) feet away from him), in a manner more be-fitting an outburst from a fan to a player at a sporting event, \"J.J.!!! Dos ma-GU-ro por favor!!!\".\n  \n  Hmm...\n  \n  I then thought to myself, \"Why, aren't they smart, these four mongoloids can speak another language. But I wonder, do they know that they aren't in a Latin-based culinary establishment. i.e.: They aren't at Taco Bell on the way back from their weekend job at Men's Wearhouse.\n  \n  Move 39, Drunken Monkey Swings Tail:\n  \n  Fortunate for me, I was seated next to the most rotund of the group. Equally fortunate for him, he had absolutely not one iota of an idea that, outside of his prison cell there exists a concept (albeit most likely mea culpa, but still, I like to NOT touch people I don't know in restaurants) called Personal Space. Not less than 18 times did his forearm rest on my serving tray before I had to spray it with a dousing of soy sauce and wasabi, or lean my freshly-poured and steaming cup of hot tea against his arm. After approx. 20 minutes of banter at extraordinarily high volumes, my newfound straight-man decided to open up to me and show his interest in my welfare. \"How's the fish here?\", he asked. \"Good\", I replied, \"Try the veal\". He scrunched the hair formations directly above his primordial ridge in utter confusion and didn't respond with so much as a \"Huh?\", which I wholeheartedly wished for.\n  \n  He then exhibited a further desire to learn more about me, since the way he figured it, even though we were sitting next to each other, his body mass was completely eclipsed my presence, thereby making it extremely difficult to place my orders in a civilized manner, and I would probably perish soon from the combined effects of lack of sunlight and starvation. \"So, what do you do?\", he inquired. \"I'm a shepherd.\", I replied, without making eye-contact, as the last time I attempted eye-contact, this cretin presumably thought I was \"stealing his soul\" with my Third Eye. I could, however, feel his frustration with this answer. Contrary to what one might think, though, I knew his frustration lie not with my sarcasm, but with the fact that my answer was mono-syllabic.\n  \n  Exeunt:\n  \n  I grew tired of dealing with a Faulknerian man-child on my arm and trying to place my order over the Party Guys' festivities and asked for my check. Upon its settlement, my new boy-toy asked, \"Are you leaving already?\" I replied, \"No.\" and walked out the door.\n  \n  Friends, don't let this happen to us as we get older and (God forbid) fatter. Let's make a pact not to act like Pendleton refugees with bad credit and a Ford Focus in the carport. Let's all try to be the cl-ASS-y guys we are.\n  \n  Thank you and Good-Night\n"

I apologize profusely and hope to make amends with some new material gleaned today from my usual Thursday jaunt to Sushi Wave in Costa Mesa.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  As I strolled into the bar, I felt a certain level of calm that I have not felt at the SW in some time. I attribute this emotion largely to the fact that I arrived relatively early to the restaurant and was one of three prospective Nigiri-Noshers, waiting anxiously for the sushi chef's wanton eye-contact like a ill-clad fat girl from the (909) trying to get someone to pay her $20 cover charge outside Aysia 101 on a Saturday night. (After all, she drove her lease-returned, re-leased 1997 Camaro, replete with a relief decal depicting Calvin (of Calvin 'n' Hobbes) urinating on what vaguely resembles a Ford Motor Company logo, all the way out to Newport, why should she have to pay her own cover?) In a matter of seconds, the sushi chef, J.J. (I have no idea what it stands for, don't ask.) has an order of yellowtail sitting on my serving board, I have a bowl of steaming miso and a cup of hot green tea, steeped to perfection. All's well right? Yeah. I wish.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  And Along Came You... Approximately a minute after I begin on the former Mr. Yellowtail, a pair of roly-poly relics from 1987 are seated next to me. I don't get too aggravated at this at first, as I'm seated on the corner (or the \\\"L\\\" as the sushi bar goes 'round the corner), better known as the best place to sit on the bar, so that my well-built, 44-inch, American shoulders aren't forced to confine themselves to a narrow, I-work-six-days-a-week-and-haven't-seen-my-wife-naked-in-fourteen-years Japanese standard of practically sitting on your neighbor's lap. Presumably, this luckily afforded personal space would prevent anyone (particularly the aforementioned Philistines) from involving themselves in my circle within the Venn Diagram Universe that is The Wave for this hour-and-a-half. I presumed wrong. Bear in mind that I am a full two-and-a-half to three feet (approx. 1 meter for my European friends) from this mongoloid and as he squats to sit his hemmorhoidal bonne-bouche down, his hairy unmanicured hand swings out and hits my bowl of miso as I lift it to my lips for a swig. Now, as I'm certain his parents would attest, accidents are accidents, but this was getting ridiculous.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Naturally, I wouldn't be so perturbed if I was likewise trussed-up in my finest Jethro Tull t-shirt and jeans shorts from Miller's Outpost. Much to my chagrin, it's Thursday, not Saturday, and I'm clad in an Ike Behar cotton shirt ($100, Macy's Men's Store), a DKNY silk tie ($68, DKNY) and a 2Xist Peruvian Pima cotton undershirt ($19, Macy's Men's Store). Not to mention that the pH balance of the miso would have a likely corrosive, if not at least sticky effect on my Montblanc Meisterstuck ($120 Montblanc store, San Francisco, pre-Price Club close-out). I calmly looked over at the Faulknerian Man-Child and with a scrunch of the forehead non-verbally inquired, \\\"What the fuck just happened here?\\\". He utters back, \\\"Dude. Sorry.\\\"\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  I shake my head. I'm too old for this crap, I'm turning 29 the week after next and I can't very well garrot a retard in one of my weekly haunts, can I? Would it be a hate crime? (These are questions for my attorney, Jeff Hegedus.) Unfortunately, hindsight is always better with your Black Flys on, and I probably could have gotten away with strangling the idiot, but I had to make do with what I had at hand. Now, as many of you know, part of the hard-wiring of my constitution is the overwhelming necessity for me to achieve balance. That is to say, if you are nice to me, I'm nice to you back, etc. Suffice it to say that I felt intensely balanced when I accidentally broke the bottle of soy sauce when reaching for the bottle in front of Mr. Flowers-for-Algernon (I had a legitimate excuse, I wanted the Low-So Kikkoman.) and the ebony liquid splendor with the signature green plastic screw-top spilled onto his $12.99 clearance-rack at Old Navy dungaree-shorts (You know, the ones that Morgan Fairchild wears in the commercials with the syphilitic dog Magic and the old bat with the East German art-critic spectacles). I wonder if he thinks it was intentional. No, I doubt he lacks the cerebral wherewithal to process such a complex set of impeti. Just as an added bonus, I didn't bother to apologize. I had a fabulous order of albacore waiting for me. (Those of you \\\"in the know\\\" know that I didn't even need the low-so soy sauce, for the albacore has a delightful citrus sauce covering it, to dip in wasabi and soy sauce would be sacrilegious.)\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  In any case, I left \\\"The Wave\\\" today feeling that the world wouldn't spin into the sun because of an imbalance in the system and my Karma-Police badge shone brightly in the Orange County sun.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Thank you and goodnight,<br>\\r\\n\\\n  Hosro Mostafavi<br>\\r\\n\\\n  Singer, Songwriter, Producer & Director<br>\\r\\n\\\n  Mad Flava Playas Productions / Skybar Exotic Films<br>\\r\\n\\\n  Holly-Wood, CA (What's your dream, baby?) \"\n"

I thought about heading to Prague,\n  but it turns out they're on that God-damned Euro, with which for\n  whatever reason, Baby Bush can't seem to achieve at least parity so\n  that my beers don't cost me USD16.00 apiece.  So, I looked East.\n  Actually, directly East, to the land of constant turmoil, conquest\n  (the bad side of it) and lots o' death camps.  US Bank is actually the\n  last remaining Nazi death camp, and I think I'll let the JDL know that\n  as soon as I get back.\n  \n  But I digress...Poland..what the hell else was I gonna do?\n  \n  So I arrived at LAX after a shuttle ride with two people who relocated\n  to Maui from Long (Strong) Beach to escape LA.  Little did they know\n  that the entire island of Maui is inhabited with people from LA!  So,\n  I got through the ticketing line at American, which was loaded with\n  gross losers on their way to Maui, dressed in every variant of Aloha\n  print possible.  As though their intent was to \"blend\".  I made it to\n  security, but not after having some idiot attorney or some-shit\n  screaming into his cell phone by way of my head, about (1) Getting\n  some \"face-time\" with XYZ client; (2) Bringing in \"John XYZ\", because\n  \"he's a closer\"; (3) \"I'll call you once I get to Maui\".  Jesus, take\n  me now.  Of course, my wardrobe choices for the trip were based on\n  comfort, as I was going to be spending 10 hours in Crotch section, but\n  security especially didn't like the idea of me wearing a belt, or\n  pants, for that matter, as they made me take my belt and ! pants\n  off at the checkpoint, presumably to demonstrate that I wasn't packing\n  my TEC-9 or a prosciutto and provolone panini for the long trip to\n  Heathrow.\n  \n  Anyway, I made it through, and in true Harris/McNiven Lonely Planet\n  World Domination Tour style, made a bee-line for the airport bar.  I\n  tucked into five solid Johnny Blacks and was in fine form to board,\n  once the call was made.  As I waited at gate 41 for my group to board\n  flight 136 to LHR, I couldn't help but notice the Carnivale D'Humanite\n  assembled for the event.  Specifically, there were three Ali G.\n  lookalikes, that could not for the life of them, stop calling each\n  other \"Nigger\" and \"Bitch\".  At one point, one of them, came up to me,\n  with what I assumed was a compliment, saying something like, \"Damn\n  Nigger, they is some sweet headphones!  Is they the noise-cancelling\n  selection?\".  Coincidentally, I had amassed a particularly large wad\n  of saliva from the dip I had in my lip at the time, which I launched\n  into my dip cup and responded, \"You got it, Hoss.\"  He seemed to like\n  this response and I think I made a friend.\n  \n  I got on the plane, and after stowing my carry-on luggage in the\n  overhead compartment, as per the flight attendants' recommendation, I\n  took my seat.  At first, I was pretty stoked, as no one seemed to be\n  assigned to to seat next to me, and I thought that things were\n  starting off right for once.  Well, along came my counterpart, a\n  rather normal-looking middle-aged white American woman, with all of\n  the travel accoutrements you would expect.  She tucked in, stowed her\n  stuff and sat down.  I introduced myself, \"Hi, I'm Michael\" and was\n  sobered by her response:\n  \n  \"Hi Michael, I'm Sister Christine of the Franciscan Order of Catholic\n  Nuns.\"\n  \n  Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  I'm on a 10-hour flight to LHR, with two\n  bottles of Cardinal Zin, a can of dip, a copy of Penthouse Forum and a\n  bag of Turkey Jerky and I get seated next to a nun.  Well, ain't that\n  some shit?\n  \n  So do any of you remember the opening scene of Dogma, where fallen\n  angel Matt Damon talks a nun out of her vocation on a train?  Sister\n  Christine and I were WASTED about two hours into the flight.  As if\n  this wasn't enough, she offered me Xanax, Ambien and Soma, just in\n  case I had trouble sleeping.  I remain impressed as ever by the\n  Catholic faith.  We discussed the Church of Rome, The Inquisition, The\n  Spanish Rape of South America and changing water into wine.  As any\n  other proper proprietor of faith-based folly would answer, \"It's the\n  way God wanted it.\"  OK.\n  \n  There was also this pair of female lightning rods on the plane, on\n  their way to Nice by way of London.  One of them was reasonably fit\n  and insisted on showing it to the entire plane by doing some kind of\n  Dianne Fossey dance routine every five minutes.  The other was\n  probably something noteworthy before electricity was discovered.  I'll\n  call her Franklin.  Franklin was very drunk and was wearing some kind\n  of backyard tent, which was arranged somehow in a way that showed more\n  skin than I believe was actually hers.  In any case, I happened to\n  draw the lucky card which allowed me to be the next one in the latrine\n  after her.  She took about 20 minutes in there, which was all right\n  because it allowed me to participate in a full ballet warm-up with her\n  idiot counterpart.  I finally gained access to the latrine, lifted up\n  the seat, eagerly anticipating some much needed bladder relief, to be\n  greeted by a most shocking surprise. ! All I'm gonna say is: Ladies,\n  if Liverpool is playing at home, make sure you flush the Cherry Pie\n  down the tube.\n  \n  Cherry Pie notwithstanding, I have been eating every pierogie in\n  sight, found a good spot to get some solid Author's Soup, (which is a\n  lot like menudo), and have been enjoying the medieval architecture and\n  cold, strong beer.  The hotel I'm in is actually loaded with\n  dignitaries and ambassadors for the European Economic Summit being\n  held this weekend, and I get that \"Can we help you sir?\" look every\n  time I walk back into the hotel lobby.\n  \n  More to come as details develop.  BTW, please don't \"respond to all\",\n  no one cares about you except me.\n  \n  Cheers, besos y abrazos\n"

  data: "--- \n:excerpt: \"\"\n:title: \"After Action Report: Krakow, Poland - 28APR2004\"\n:content: |-\n  Good day y'all,\n  \n  It's day 6.5 of my trip, and it's now cold, raining and I'm actually\n  tired of drinking and smoking, (if you can believe that).  I'm\n  currently in Krakow, in Southern Poland.  (Pauly, run and get your\n  globe and have Jen show you where Europe is.)  I arrived here last\n  Sunday, through a few miracles and the hand of God, I'm quite certain.\n  \n  Sunday morning I woke up extra early, to take in a last proper walk\n  around Warsaw's very charming Old Town district, and to watch the\n  magnificent changing of the guard ceremony at the tomb of the unknown\n  soldier.  I also wanted to be certain that I didn't miss my 14:15\n  train from Warsaw's Central Station to Krakow.  The way I had it\n  timed, I'd be tucked into a cozy cafe, chewing pierogies and sloshing\n  down a beer or ten in the shadow of Castle Wawel by 17:00.  No such\n  fucking luck.\n  \n  So, I arrive at the Warsaw train station at about 13:30, plenty of\n  time before the train's scheduled departure time.  Let me just fill in\n  a couple of very important details regarding the Warsaw Central train\n  station: (1) I had been wondering where the urine-soaked post-Soviet\n  Bloc heroin addicts and prostitutes were all congregating for their\n  afternoon marketing meetings and networking events.  Evidently, they\n  keep their domestic headquarters in the confines of the Warsaw train\n  station.  (2) In spite of the fact that Poland will be joining the EU\n  in exactly three days, the country has made the very wise decision to\n  employ NOBODY who speaks a single syllable of English, Spanish, French\n  or Esperanto at the train station, and further helping my situation,\n  not a single word of English is printed in the train station, except\n  that found on the ubiquitous Marlboro and Coca-Cola adverts (I'm not\n  sure that that even qualifies as English anymore. ! I think Marketing\n  is the new Esperanto.)  (3) Polish is about the most difficult\n  language I have ever experienced in my life.  I think some\n  Austro-Prussian-German-Russian asshole in the 9th century, high on\n  mead in the countryside, thought \"Hey, it might be funny to create a\n  language that utilized the same basic principles of Celtic, that is,\n  pronunciation of the word you're looking at sounds nothing like it\n  appears, but with even more consanants.  I don't think he ever meant\n  it to get this far.  It's no wonder the inventor of Esperanto was\n  Polish.  He just wanted a simpler life!  And here's a real shocker:\n  The Nazi's Enigma Code was cracked by a team of Polish code-breakers.\n  Oh, that's a surprise, Enigma was probably a walk in the park compared\n  to trying to say \"Walk in the park\" in Polish.  But I digress...\n  \n  So, I remembered reading something in my Lonely Planet about the\n  Departures being listed on a Yellow board and the Arrivals being\n  listed on a White board...or was it vice versa?  Ahhh, whatever, I'll\n  figure it out.  I'm the seasoned Citizen Du Monde!  If I can make my\n  way around Linea Cuatro in Barcelona, I can make it any-fucking-where.\n  \n  I noticed on the White board that a train associated with Krakow was\n  due at 14:20.  Not bad, I thought, it's only five minutes late.  I'll\n  just drop into one of the many bars at the station and have a beer and\n  a sandwich, and write in my journal for a little while.  Well, around\n  14:00, I decided to go down to Platform 4, from where my train was due\n  to take off at 14:20.  I only had a 20-minute wait, so I'd chill, have\n  a grit and people/junky-watch.  (By the way, at one point the\n  Junkies/Urine Soaker Welcoming Committee were so very kind as to help\n  me to make sure that everything was very safely stowed away and\n  zipped-up in my bags and pockets!  How considerate!  They did this by\n  clustering around me and asking me for money all at once, so as to\n  \"confuse and frighten\" me.  No worries, I just backed up against a\n  wall, lit a cigarette and started waiving it in their faces.  It\n  reminded me of that video gam! e, Castle Wolfenstein, where you waive\n  fire in zombies' faces and they make this moaning sound.  HA!  But I\n  digress...)\n  \n  So, I'm on the platform, and a train pulls up at about 14:25.  I watch\n  as all these people, mostly students, got off, receiving hugs and\n  kisses from whomever greeted them.  It was about 14:30 when I decided\n  to ask one of the conductors if the train just arrived was headed to\n  Krakow.  He laughed and said, \"No!  This just came from Krakow!  Ha ha\n  ha ha ha ha ha!!!\"  Well, fuck me.  I could have just opened my LP and\n  confirmed that Yellow was for Departures and White was for Arrivals,\n  but no.  I knew what I was doing.  So, I figured out through the\n  fucking cryptic train schedule that another train (the last one of the\n  day) was due to leave at 16:15.  But could it be so easy that I simply\n  jump on that train with my existing ticket?  Come on.  This place was\n  run by the Soviets for 50 years.  You think a ticket on the Great Iron\n  Horse could be transferable?  So I had to wait in three lines, and!\n  luckily I had these two Polish girls who spoke English helping me\n  along the way.  They shared my very strong belief in Travel Karma:\n  someday you'll need help too.  So, three new tickets, about seven\n  hundred stamps (remember that, Rick?) and nine thousand evil eye\n  stares from the old Soviet bitties working the ticket windows, I was\n  ready to roll.  And I had about ten minutes to spare.\n  \n  I got on the God-damned train, two hours late and finally made it into\n  Krakow at 18:50.  By 19:05 I was on the street, determined to find a\n  nice cafe in which I could find my bearings and then a restaurant for\n  dinner.  Well, as it turns out, my hotel, the Pod Roza, is about as\n  centrally-located as you can get.  Krakow is an ancient city, which\n  was actually a major trade nexus through the late 19th century.  The\n  main square, which is larger than Venice's Gran Piazza, is\n  breathtaking.  The main feature is St. Mary's church, built in the\n  10th century.  There is a huge bell tower, which is rung every hour on\n  the hour.  But what's really cool is that there is a bugler that plays\n  a traditional tune in each of the four directions from the top of the\n  bell tower.  The funny part is that the tune gets interrupted at a\n  certain point at each stop, due to a tradition that pays homage to a\n  former bugler in the Middle Ages that rece! ived a Tatar arrow in the\n  throat just as he was playing the tune.  There is so much tradition in\n  this town, much much more than Warsaw has.  I also found my new\n  favorite bar in Europe: Harris Piano Jazz Bar.  It is a cellar bar\n  that features live jazz every night and the proprietors refuse to let\n  me pay for any drinks after I showed them my passport, proving my\n  surname.  Gotta love it, almost as good as Memphis.\n  \n  Another point that I haven't gotten to mention yet is the food.  My\n  God.  I decided to let this country stretch its gastronomic gams and\n  boy, have I been pleased.  From traditional peasant restaurants to a\n  posh cellar French brasserie to a Kebab at 3:00 in the morning outside\n  the ancient Florian Gates, I have not been disappointed once.  And the\n  beer, my God, the beer.  Europe is so much better.\n  \n  I toured the death camps of Auschwitz and Birkenau yesterday.  It is\n  frightening to bear witness to humanity's boundless propensity for\n  cruelty and torture.  I tell ya, you give those Germans a project and\n  they really run with it.  The weather changes as soon as you set foot\n  on the grounds of Auschwitz.  There are displays and exhibits of\n  suitcases, hair, eyeglasses, shoes, pots and pans, prayer shawls, and\n  hair brushes confiscated upon arrival.  The real horror occurred in\n  two barracks though, Doctor Josef Mengele's \"hospital\" and the\n  SS/Gestapo building, located side-by-side in the far corner of the\n  camp.  In the former, the good doctor performed his world (in)famous\n  experiments on twins such as cutting one of each twin in half and\n  sewing the different halves back together to see if the bodies could\n  live.  You know, stuff that really benefited humankind.  The latter\n  gave me the chills, as the evil was very much aliv! e in the\n  SS/Gestapo building, where political prisoners were taken apart or\n  tortured in exotic ways such as \"The Stand\" where four to six\n  prisoners at once were placed in a 3'x3' cell, standing and forbidden\n  to sleep or sit for days to weeks on end.  Oh yeah, they were required\n  to perform heavy labor during the day.  Another area of fun and games\n  for the SS/G was 'The Post', where prisoners were hung by their\n  wrists, over their heads, behind their backs, outdoors of course.  Not\n  to bore you, but they also had a suffocation cell, which when closed,\n  had absolutely no circulation, so the prisoner would die in a matter\n  of a couple of days.  Birkenau was a massive, massive, silent death\n  factory about 2km down the road.  Evil is also very present here,\n  especially in a lake in the back of the camp, which stills glows grey\n  from all of the ash in the water.  The whole complex is by far, the\n  most moving thing I have ever seen.  It's impossible not to sh! ed a\n  tear as you walk the grounds imagining the unmitigated terror exacted\n  on 6.5MM people in this place.  And I had the fortune of seeing it on\n  a flawless, sunny spring afternoon.  I can only imagine this place in\n  the dead of a Polish winter.\n  \n  I have been most impressed with the people I've met thus far on my\n  visit here.  It is interesting to note the different temperaments that\n  exist between those people who remember Soviet life and those who\n  barely do, or don't at all.  As I mentioned, the country joins the EU\n  on Saturday 01MAY2004, and there is a quiet scepticism exuded by the\n  older folks that can't be denied.  They've seen it all, and I can read\n  it on their faces: \"Great, we just got our independence back fourteen\n  years ago and we're about to give it up again.\"  But the younger folks\n  are very enthusiastic about the enlargement, though many of them\n  intend to leave the country as soon as possible, for higher paying\n  jobs in Western Europe.  This place may become the new Prague at some\n  point, I just hope it doesn't get overrun by loud-mouthed Americans\n  with money belts and fanny packs.\n  \n  Well, I think I've written quite enough for one report.  I get back on\n  Friday, see you at Memphis.  Save me a Scotch.\n  \n  Cheers, besos y abrazos.\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  Went home from work friday feeling prety low.  I had the achy\n  body, the beginnings of a sore throat, and an unconquerable\n  headache.  Took a big nap and some vites, and felt quite a bit\n  better toward the evening.\n  \n  That was good since Pop and I had planned to fly one of the\n  Tomahawks from WVI to SBP.  We would meet up with Arti and Mimi\n  who would be driving the pickup loaded up with our old oven and\n  microwave to deliver to Em and Mark.\n  \n  We met up with Mimi and Pop at <a\n  href=http://www.oceanairflightservices.com>Ocean Air</a> at about\n  9am Saturday.\n  \n  The fog layer was hanging thick and low, and showed no signs of\n  clearing.  Bummer for VFR Pop and me.  So we decided to all drive\n  south, caravan style.\n  \n  We arrived in Los Osos a couple of hours later to witness Mark\n  putting the finishing touches on their lovely new backyard.  He\n  made a killer curved shed (with curved doors) and a picnic table\n  set out of a huge plank of wood he got from a friend.  He does\n  first-class work.\n  \n  Mark and I installed the microwave pretty quickly in a spot made\n  for it in their kitchen, then we all took a little siesta.\n  \n  I got in touch with the Drique, who was up visiting the Bellmans\n  with Kendra, and Isabella.  Ari, Marlen, and Ariella also drove up\n  from LA.  We planned to meet up at El Casa de Bellman at 7pm for a\n  seafood feast.\n  \n  The Bellmans' place is great -- up in the hills of Atascadero.\n  Great air, views, and dark nights to check out all the stars.\n  The plan was to boil up several bucketloads of crab, shrimp, and\n  mussels, and eat it off the table.  It was great fun -- they set\n  up a few tables in their garage, covered them with paper, and\n  dumped out the pots of seafood goodness in three big piles.  There\n  were about 20 of us there to enjoy it.\n  \n  Everyone ate till they could stuff nary a mussel into their\n  bellies.  We capped the night with some tasty peach and strawberry\n  pie a la mode with coffee out on the front porch by the chimley.\n  \n  We headed back to Em and Mark's place around 11pm, and went\n  straight to bed.\n  \n  Shortly after getting cozy in our sleeping bags, I started to feel\n  a rumbling in my belly.  About a half hour of worrying about\n  throwing up found me making the Vomitously Mad Dash to the\n  bathroom to enjoy the dinner again, but played in reverse.  \n  \n  Too too bad -- it was such a tasty meal.  I was up all night going\n  back and forth between the sleeping bag  and the toilet (\"this\n  had better better be the last time i pu.... back to worship Her\n  Porcelainness!\").  Things finally settled down around 4:30AM.  I\n  was empty.\n  \n  A couple hours of sleep later, it was time to wake up.  A big\n  breakfast for everyone else (mint tea and dry toast for me) and it\n  was time to head to the big 4th of July parade in Cayucos.\n  \n  Cayucos is a town of maybe a thousand people.  But on the 4th,\n  EVERYONE from the area -- SLO to Paso Robles -- converge on the\n  main street of Cayucos for a big, old-timey parade.  From the\n  local Hot Rodders, to the Harmony Elk's Lodge, to the local high\n  school baton twirling club, it's happening in Cayucos.  \n  \n  Photos of the weekend are <a\n  href=http://nobot.2y.net/pictures/july_4_2004-los_osos/>here</a>.\n  \n  We met up with the Cruzaleguis, Bellmans, and Gatis around\n  lunchtime and had a bite to eat.\n  \n  By this time, D and D Stein were getting a bit restless, and I was\n  just about ready to fall over from lack of water, sleep, and\n  calories, so we decided it was a good time to go.\n  \n  Goodbyes all around, back to Em and Mark's place to pack up, and\n  we came back home.  It was nice to be back here where things are\n  cozy and familiar.\n  \n  We took it easy that evening, but headed down the street just\n  after 9pm to watch the fireworks show the city puts on.  It was\n  just about canceled this year due to lack of funds, but some\n  pyrotechnicophiles got together and raised enough money to put on\n  the show.  It was really exciting -- they do it in a park that's a\n  few blocks from our house, so we got right up to it.  Here are\n  some <a\n  href=http://nobot.2y.net/pictures/july_4_2004-fireworks/>pictures</a>\n  of the show.\n  \n  On Monday, we took care of some projects around the house, then\n  went for an AWESOME hike at <a\n  href=http://www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/castlerock.html>Castle\n  Rock</a>.  We arrived at the trailhead around 6pm, and hiked about\n  6 miles.  I stopped a lot for <a\n  href=http://nobot.2y.net/pictures/july_5_2004-castle_rock/>photos</a>, so we didn't get back until\n  after 9pm.  It was the best Bay Area hike I've been on.  Lots of\n  varied terrain, interesting rock formations, excellent views of\n  the Coastal Range and the Pacific, waterfalls, Madrone trees.\n  Most of the hike is in the shade, and doesn't carry on for too\n  long going up or downhill, though there are some strenuous and\n  technical parts of the trails.\n  \n  In sum, a great long weekend -- just wish I could keep those mussels down!\n\n:title: Independence Day Diary\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

Apparently,\n  there is an unwritten rule in big boy, big league,\n  network journalism that if something has been said at\n  least twice, by anyone with a mike, then it must be\n  true and, thus, worth repeating as an accent aigu to\n  your 20 second news vingnette; sort of like the way\n  Telemundo soccer announcers speak out a sponsor's tag\n  line every time the product is mentioned.  \"Este\n  partido de Chivas contra Monterrey patrocinado por\n  Butt-whiserrr; siempre refrescante, siempre!\"  ...or\n  in this case, \"Senator John Kerry spoke at Cape\n  Canaveral today, in large part to reverse the trend\n  that most Americans still don't know who John Kerry is\n  or what he stands for.\"  \"Siempre!\"\n  \n  Can we be that base? Are we merely at the trough of\n  this heinous televised wave, ready to bust the\n  proverbial bottom-turn and rise up to a triumphant\n  off-the-lip, sticking our ass out in mockery at our\n  intellectually anchored anchormen and anchorwomen?  I\n  surely hope so.  I pray it so, but I doubt it.\n  \n  How hard can it be to look up something that is all\n  out in the public record.  Is it that difficult to\n  open Google and type in \"Senate Voting Record.\"  I\n  tried this today and got over 666,000 hits.  How hard\n  is it to type in www.JohnKerry.com?  Not very\n  difficult, even with the \"J\" and the \"K\" in caps.\n  \n  How hard is it to flip channels and find something\n  that speaks in great detail on Kerry's voting record\n  on matters of great import like, for example, the\n  Prescription Drug Benefit Bill, or the environment, or\n  a woman's right to choose?  Next to impossible.\n  \n  By contrast, want to know about the color of Ashton\n  Kutcher last bowel movement?  Certainly! What day of\n  the week would you like to inquire about?  Would you\n  like to be thoroughly schooled on the day that Lucy\n  Liu kissed a shoeless guy at a hospital in Burma?  Of\n  course!  We have a two part series for you.\n  \n  In closing, dear Elois, I find myself thinking back to\n  the prophetic words and the young voices of England's\n  own Ned's Atomic Dustbin.  If ever something deserved\n  to be killed, gangland style, seven times in the\n  chest, it most certainly is our television.  Kill that\n  bitch.\n  \n  ...now can someone help me dispose of the body?\n  \n  -e-\n  \n"

I disappeared down a staircase, and\r\n  ended up in the foyer area of this elusive 9th floor.\r\n  \r\n  This time, Apple had taken up shop in the top spot.  Their door\r\n  was this huge stuffed leather door with a 3ft tall illuminated\r\n  white apple logo in the center.\r\n  \r\n  I tried to push it open, but just as my hand touched, I noticed a\r\n  security guard on the opposite side of the area.\r\n  \r\n  I nonchalantly made my way to the elevator, which dropped like a\r\n  rock to the ground floor.  I was dressed in a suit coat, tie\r\n  loosely hung around my neck, tee shirt, and shorts.  I was\r\n  sincerely hoping that nobody from the top-secret Apple exec team\r\n  was waiting to get into their special elevator at the first floor.\r\n  \r\n  Then I woke up.\r\n  \r\n  I've had many dreams in this location, always going to the secret\r\n  9th floor, always narrowly escaping trouble.\r\n  \r\n  Other common locations:\r\n  <ul><li>beach town</li>\r\n      <li>green hills</li>\r\n      <li>the danky concrete toilet megaplex (I have this\r\n  phobia with public restrooms)\r\n      <li>hmmm ... i know there are others\r\n  </ul>\r\n\n:title: Recurring Dream Locations\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

It was flimsy and inaccurate,\r\n  but it was all I had.\r\n  \r\n  On the way back from <a\r\n  href=http://www.southernlumber.com/>Southern\r\n  Lumber</a>, i had an idea... I could use the \"Shop\r\n  Stop\" on my <a href=http://www.incra.biz/Products/miter1000se.html>Incra Miter 1000 SE</a> to hold a piece\r\n  securely for a good taper.  Since the miter gauge goes\r\n  all the way to 95 degrees in each direction, I could\r\n  do any sort of taper.\r\n  \r\n  Check the photos above for how it looks in action.\r\n  \r\n  The only limitation I can see is in the width of the\r\n  piece it can cut, since it's limited to how far the\r\n  gauge can adjust within the saw's miter slots.\n:title: Miter 1000 SE is a Great Taper Jig\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: \"Since we got our new furniture, including home made TV\\n\\\n  stand, our glass-and-metal coffee table is sticking\\n\\\n  out like a sore thumb.  It's cold, heavy, and hard --\\n\\\n  especially when you hit your shin on it late at night\\n\\\n  with the lights off.  Also, there's no place to put\\n\\\n  the TV remote, computer keyboard, or mouse when\\n\\\n  they're not being used.\\n\\n\\\n  Enter the woodshop.\\n\\n\\\n  Saturday morning brought Arti and I to a post-Peete's\\n\\\n  excursion to <a\\n\\\n  href=http://www.southernlumber.com/>Southern\\n\\\n  Lumber</a>.  I had drawn up a plan the night before\\n\\\n  for a new table to fit our needs.\\n\\n\\\n  One of the great thing about working with wood is that\\n\\\n  an idea doesn't need to be drawn out with exact\\n\\\n  measurements or detail.  It's totally possible to\\n\\\n  build a piece of furniture that fits together tightly,\\n\\\n  but was designed and built without doing any\\n\\\n  measurements at all!  So armed with a general idea of\\n\\\n  what we wanted to build, we went to get the wood for\\n\\\n  this project.\\n\\n\\\n  We got home from the wood store in mid-morning, and I\\n\\\n  tore into the boards.\\n\\n\\\n  We went through a couple of design iterations, and\\n\\\n  ended up with a plan that eliminated the need for\\n\\\n  about  $150 worth of wood while making for a more\\n\\\n  pleasing piece.  That excess can now be returned or\\n\\\n  reused.\\n\\n\\\n  I worked until about 4pm Saturday -- we were having a\\n\\\n  party and expected people to start showing up at 5pm. \\n\\\n  At that point all of the wood was cut, miters were\\n\\\n  fine-tuned, and tenons were dadoed.  Pretty good\\n\\\n  progress.\\n\\n\\\n  Sunday was an open day.  After we had breakfast with\\n\\\n  Ghizal and Pauly (and removed the badges from the back\\n\\\n  of his 'bu), it was back to the garage to finish\\n\\\n  things up.\\n\\n\\\n  I started with the assembly of the table top, moved to\\n\\\n  the tapers on the legs (see previous article), then\\n\\\n  the leg mortises (note to self:  do mortises *before*\\n\\\n  tapering!!!).  By this time, the glue holding the\\n\\\n  table top together had dried, so I pulled the clamps\\n\\\n  off that to assemble the bottom part of the table.\\n\\n\\\n  I sanded the top and bottom of the table top smooth,\\n\\\n  cleaned up a bit, then moved on to sanding the base\\n\\\n  after the glue had dried.\\n\\n\\\n  I then moved on to the inlay on the top of the table. \\n\\\n  I had cut a rabbit in each table top \\\"wrapper\\\" piece\\n\\\n  to accept a 1/4\\\" square piece of Bolivian Rosewood.  I\\n\\\n  bought a piece of 6\\\" by 1/4\\\" of this dark wood, and\\n\\\n  rough-cut some 1/4\\\"+ strips on the table saw.  So i\\n\\\n  cut each strip to length on the miter saw, beveling\\n\\\n  each edge at 45 degrees.  It took some fine tuning\\n\\\n  with the hand plane (big fun!) and sandpaper to get\\n\\\n  each piece to the perfect width.  I glued those\\n\\\n  suckers in, waited a bit, then planed and sanded them\\n\\\n  flush with the top.\\n\\n\\\n  So it's almost ready for finishing.  I just need to do\\n\\\n  some final 320 grit sanding and drill some holes in\\n\\\n  the legs and table top to acomodate a hidden dowel\\n\\\n  type of  attachment system to keep the whole thing\\n\\\n  together and tight.\\n\\n\\\n  Lessons Learned:\\n\\\n  - Miter 1000 SE for tapers\\n\\\n  - mortise before tapering\\n\\\n  - tables work best and are strong and square with two\\n\\\n  stretchers per side between each pair of legs. \\n\\\n  assembling this table and getting it vertically square\\n\\\n  with only one stretcher was a big pain.\\n\\n\\\n  It should be finished by the end of this week.  We're\\n\\\n  gonna run some tests with different stains and\\n\\\n  finishes to see what works best on this hybrid\\n\\\n  Cherry/Birch/Rosewood piece. \"\n:title: New Coffee Table Nearing Completion\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  Here are two stories for the archives....\n  \n  Sometime in 1995 when I was living on Orange Ave in Costa Mesa\n  with Ryan and Mike, I witnessed  a great lightning storm.  \n  \n  It was around 9 or 10PM at the end of a mostly normal, warm, clear\n  Orange County day.  I can't remember exactly how we first noticed\n  it -- I think I was coming home from school or work when I saw it\n  -- but I recall seeing a flurry of lightning activity far in the\n  distance, in the direction of the ocean.  This lightning didn't\n  let up -- it was continuous.\n  \n  We lived on the 2nd (top) floor of a little apartment building, so\n  we got up on the roof of our place to watch it.  We were up there\n  for fifteen minutes at least just watching this clump of\n  continuous lightning when we decided to go find it.\n  \n  We drove down the 55 freeway to Newport, then turned north up\n  PCH.  There was just this clump of clouds just off the coast that\n  was just going nuts with lightning.  We found a place to park near\n  the sand, and went out onto the beach to watch this thing.\n  \n  We sat there for a long, long time just watching this amazing\n  show.  There was a lightning strike at least every second, many\n  times several at once.  It was silent too -- there was an offshore\n  breeze, which may have contributed to the lack of noise.\n  \n  After an hour, we decided to go home.  The lightning cloud had\n  disapated a bit, and we thought it may be drifting toward us, so\n  we figured it was time to go home.\n  \n  \n  \n  The other amazing lightning experience I had happened more\n  recently.  Arti, my parents, and I went down to Moss Landing an\n  evening in November 2003 to do a \"Full Moon Kayak\" excursion.\n  \n  There are a few Kayak shops in the Moss Landing area, and several\n  offer nighttime trips when the full moon provides enough light to\n  navigate.  I had done a similar trip in 1999 or 2000 with Mona and\n  Musty in Santa Cruz, so I was excited to have another chance to be\n  out on the water at night.\n  \n  We paddled out from the harbor at sunset, and slowly made our way out to\n  the estuary as nighttime made its own slow way over us.  An hour\n  or so later we were deep in the estuary, surrounded by birds,\n  fish, and the occasional sea otter poking its head up out of the\n  water.\n  \n  Looking east, there were some clouds building up near the hills in\n  the distance.  From the shape of the clouds, it seemed that there\n  was a pretty good wind blowing out there.  There were a couple of\n  occasional lightning strikes as we were paddling out.  Most were\n  pretty dim, others were bright.\n  \n  This built up slowly over the course of a half hour or so into an\n  interesting, sometimes continuous show.\n  \n  It was a great experience to be in a little boat, sitting on the\n  surface of the smooth water, not a sound to be heard except for\n  the sporadic calls of nighttime shorebirds, watching this visually\n  amazing nature show in the distance reflecting off the water's\n  surface.\n\n:title: Lightning Stories\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  Got the new TV last night ... well, it's not so much a TV as a\r\n  giant computer screen.\r\n  \r\n  It's a 37\" Sharp LCD/TFT display.  It will do 1280x768 resolution,\r\n  and can also do a side-by-side screen from different input sources\r\n  (computer, tv, dvd, etc).  \r\n  \r\n  So far so good -- I've connected my laptop to it, and it's just\r\n  awesome to be able to compute from across the living room.\r\n  \r\n  A note to anyone who is trying to get the full widescreen resolution from their video card:  In my case, the laptop has a Radeon video card in it.  The only way I could figure out how to run in 1280x768 was to download  <a href=http://www.rage3d.com/>Rage3dTweak</a> in order to enable some \"hidden\" resolutions the card could do.  Install the software, enable 1280x768, reboot, then select 1280x768 in the display control panel.  Once I did that, I had to manually set the TV to 1280x768 mode and everything was golden.\r\n  \r\n  Also, running the \"Auto Setup\" menu option on the TV under where the computer signal sync options are set made a HUGE difference in the quality of the picture.\r\n  \r\n  Future Enhancements:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>Today: Get an ART CleanBox, which connects unbalanced RCA to\r\n  balanced XLR devices.  Since I'm using the Mackie monitors, I may\r\n  as well hook them up balanced.  Also, the Echo Mia has balanced\r\n  outs, so i can have as good a signal as possibly going into the\r\n  receiver with the CleanBox.\r\n  <li>Put a whole computer behind/under it so that I don't have to\r\n  dock/undock the laptop every day.\r\n  <li>Put the Echo Mia soundcard in the computer, to do Reason and\r\n  other audio stuff nicely\r\n  <li>Put a video capture card in the computer, preferably a hi-def\r\n  model.  Initially i can use this to have a \"tv window\" while using\r\n  the computer, maybe later to be used as a computer-based PVR.\r\n  </ul>\r\n  Consumerism?  What's that?\r\n\n:title: TV Upgrade\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

And as he takes on a higher political profile, it is hard to tell who is happier, Republicans or Democrats.</P>\r\n  <P>At the rally here, Mr. Cheney was immediately forgiven by some members of the invited crowd for swearing at Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont on the Senate floor on Tuesday. It showed him, they said, to be a real person who is forceful in the face of unwarranted criticism.</P>\r\n  <P>\"It tells me Cheney is very human,\" said Dennis Lumphrey, a hospital worker from Moville, Iowa, who was in the crowd. \"It also tells me he's not going to get pushed around. He'll fight back. A lot of people around the world want to tell America what to do. We need to have our own direction and priorities.\"</P>\r\n  <P><A href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/top/news/washington/campaign2004/candidates/georgewbush/index.html?inline=nyt-per-pol\"><FONT color=#000066>President Bush's</FONT></A> political aides said they anticipated no negative aftereffects. In fact, the White House announced that Mr. Cheney's campaign schedule would only intensify. Next weekend, he will take a bus tour through Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. And senior Republicans said he had proved himself a voice of wisdom and reassurance to voters on the two big topics of the race, the economy and the fight against terrorism.</P>\r\n  <P>\"He's a tremendous asset to the Republican party,\" said Ed Gillespie, chairman of the Republican National Committee. \"The rank-and-file Republican voters out there just love Dick Cheney. They appreciate his loyalty to the president, and they appreciate that he feels solid.\"</P>\r\n  <P>But Mr. Cheney has been drawing even more partisan fire than usual over the last few weeks. His aggressive defense of the administration's assertions that Iraq was working with Al Qaeda intensified the long-running partisan and ideological clash over whether he helped lead the nation to war under false pretenses. </P>\r\n  <P>He won a short-term legal victory when the Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a lower court had acted \"prematurely\" when it rejected his request to block disclosure of records from his energy policy task force. But the ruling brought the issue to the fore again, allowing Democrats to renew their attacks that he has sought to work behind closed doors to further the interests of energy companies.</P>\r\n  <P>Now more than ever, his opponents call Mr. Cheney among the most polarizing figures in politics. Democrats portray him as the power behind the throne and the personification of militarism, corporate corruption and government secrecy.</P>\r\n  <P>\"We've got to get the White House back from a man who has abused his power as the leader of the free world,\" the comedian Billy Crystal told the crowd at a Democratic fund-raiser in Los Angeles on Thursday night. \"Dick Cheney has got to go.\"</P>\r\n  <P>Mr. Bush's Democratic rival, <A href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/top/news/washington/campaign2004/candidates/johnfkerry/index.html?inline=nyt-per-pol\"><FONT color=#000066>Senator John Kerry</FONT></A> of Massachusetts, regularly repeats Mr. Cheney's name in much the same way Republicans have long used that of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton- as a symbol of all that is wrong with the policies and personalities of the opposing party.</P>\r\n  <P>\"Cheney's definitely turned into a big, fat albatross around the president's neck,\" said Jim Jordan, Mr. Kerry's former campaign manager.</P>\r\n  <P>\"His public image is very bad and getting worse,\" Mr. Jordan said. Mr. Cheney's aides and supporters said one of his great strengths as a campaigner was his ability to remain stoic about the way he is portrayed by Democrats and immune from the pressures of responding to the ups and downs of daily news cycles.</P>\r\n  <P>But the exchange with Mr. Leahy on Tuesday suggested that Democrats manage to get under Mr. Cheney's skin.</P>\r\n  <P>Interviewed by Fox News on Friday after a speech in Saginaw, Mich., Mr. Cheney did not specifically acknowledge using the expletive that he has been widely reported to have used. \"Well, I expressed myself rather forcefully, felt better after I had done it,\" Mr. Cheney said. Asked whether he was angry about Mr. Leahy's suggestions that the Halliburton Company had received no-bid contracts in Iraq because Mr. Cheney ran the company before joining the Republican ticket four years ago, the vice president said that was part of it.</P>\r\n  <P>\"Also, it had to do with - he is the kind of individual who will make those kinds of charges and then come after you as though he's your best friend,\" Mr. Cheney said.</P>\r\n  <P>Mr. Leahy's aides said the incident occurred when Mr. Cheney gathered with members of the Senate for a formal portrait on the Senate floor on Tuesday. Mr. Leahy was chatting with Republicans, they said, when he spied Mr. Cheney and approached him. When Mr. Cheney turned away, Mr. Leahy, the aides said, joked that the vice president was unwilling to talk to Democrats.</P>\r\n  <P>After Mr. Cheney expressed his \"dissatisfaction\" with Mr. Leahy, as the vice president put it to Fox News, Mr. Leahy \"told Mr. Cheney that he and Senate Democrats didn't appreciate being called anti-Catholic,\" said David Carle, Mr. Leahy's spokesman. Mr. Leahy was referring to Republican accusations that Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee were \"anti-Catholic\" because they refused to confirm a judicial nominee, William H. Pryor Jr., who opposed abortion. Mr. Leahy is the senior Democrat on the panel. </P>\r\n  <P>Then Mr. Cheney stalked off, Mr. Leahy's aides said, using an obscene phrase to describe what he thought Mr. Leahy should do. </P>\r\n  <P>In a statement issued after Fox News broadcast its interview with Mr. Cheney, Mr. Carle said, \"It appears the vice president's previous calls for civility are now inoperative.\"</P>\r\n  <P>By forcing Mr. Cheney to address his personal conduct, the incident brought a rare moment of improvisation to the vice president's campaign, which has so far been a highly orchestrated affair directed primarily at raising money and rousing the Republican faithful.</P>\r\n  <P>Mr. Cheney does not do rapid response, the daily back and forth between the campaigns, and he rarely addresses issues like education or Mr. Bush's \"compassionate conservative\" agenda. He plays the traditional vice-presidential role of attacking the opposition, but his stump speech parrots the same lines about Mr. Kerry that Mr. Bush uses in his speeches.</P>\r\n  <P>Mr. Cheney's strength, his aides and supporters said, is in setting out what the stakes are in the election.</P>\r\n  <P>\"We'll have him do what he does best and has done best, which is to take the needed step back to provide perspective about the challenges we face and the policies we need,\" said Mary Matalin, a former senior aide to Mr. Cheney who will join him on the campaign trail this summer. \"He's a political reality zone.\"</P>\r\n  <P>To soften up Mr. Cheney's somewhat wooden public persona, he is often introduced, as he was here, by his wife, Lynne Cheney. She told a story about how she wore a strapless red dress made by her grandmother on her first date with Mr. Cheney and how she credited the dress with their having a second date.</P>\r\n  <P>Republican strategists said Mr. Cheney, a former House member, takes a keen interest in the nuts and bolts of electoral politics. </P>\r\n  <P>\"He has a very well developed sense of campaign strategy and campaign tactics,\" said one prominent Republican in Washington who has close ties to Mr. Cheney. \"He understands how to read a poll and the cross tabs. He'll delve into message and the things that inform campaign decisions. But he's less likely to involve himself in detail than to try to spark people's thinking or challenge people's thinking.\"</P><!--author id start -->\r\n  <P></P>\r\n  <P><EM>Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting for this article.</EM></P></NYT_TEXT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><p>\r\n  		<hr size=1>Do you Yahoo!?<br>\r\n  Read only the mail you want - <a href=\"http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/spamguard/*http://promotions.yahoo.com/new_mail/static/protection.html\">Yahoo!

Bush was shown attempting empathy with the parents of lost military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan -- people screamed obscenities in a visceral, pre-riot manner reminiscent of a WTO protest.&nbsp; Haven't seen anything like that in the community of Irvine before, and I lived there for 5 years.</DIV>\n  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n  <DIV>During the film's image of the Iraqi parent crying and screaming appeals to God in Arabic upon the loss of her child,&nbsp;a few Arabic or Mid-Eastern audience members (presumably) repeated her words in Arabic by yelling in the theatre.&nbsp; I sense it was these same people, a few elderly Mid-Easterners,&nbsp;who were crying upon exiting the theatre.</DIV>\n  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n  <DIV>Indeed, upon exiting, I hung out for a bit.&nbsp; Fifty and sixty-something American parents were crying and cursing, while still a few guys were shaking their heads and complaining over anecdotes like showing the vapid Britney Spears and the use of the \"Bonanza\" TV-theme and image.&nbsp; Certain people huddled and talked about how they felt like they needed to see it again in order to fully absorb the information presented in the film on items such as&nbsp;The Carlyle Group, Unocal's pipeline project in Afghanistan, the post-Iraq-invasion energy conference coverage&nbsp;and other rarely publicly exhibited current affairs tidbits.&nbsp; </DIV>\n  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n  <DIV>I also spoke with the voter registration crew out in front of the theatre.&nbsp; They informed me of the high value of registering for the November 2nd Presidential Election in a manner that would leave a PAPER TRAIL.&nbsp; I.E. Registering via absentee ballot or being prepared to submit a paper ballot on election day.&nbsp; Apparently, a voter machine company, local to Orange County, has been procured by the County for the elections...</DIV>\n  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n  <DIV>Despite it's \"independent film\" status and modest (by <EM>Spiderman, Dodgeball</EM>&nbsp;and <EM>White Chicks</EM> standards) national distribution, this movie was certainly an \"event film\".&nbsp; I would urge you to see it if you haven't, and let other citizens know about it, especially any of your conservative friends, regardless of what anyone thinks of Moore.&nbsp; There are certain indisputably important macro-economic and political issues touched upon in the film that I sense will rarely, if ever, appear in any prominent domestically produced&nbsp;audio-visual media product again.&nbsp; I'm shocked yet impressed, frankly, that he was able to include some of these issues in the final cut.</DIV>\n  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n  <DIV><A href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/expresstimes/pa/index.ssf?/base/news-11/1088413528318620.xml\" target=_blank><FONT color=#003399>http://www.nj.com/news/expresstimes/pa/index.ssf?/base/news-11/1088413528318620.xml</FONT></A></DIV></DIV></DIV><p>\n  		<hr size=1>Do you Yahoo!?<br>\n  <a href=\"http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/aac/*http://promotions.yahoo.com/new_mail/static/ease.html\">Yahoo!

Our flight left\r\n  San Francisco at 1:30AM, so it was lights out nearly\r\n  all the way.  It stayed dark outside for 95% of the\r\n  trip, so much sleep was had by all.\r\n   \r\n  We landed in Hong Kong at 5:30AM local time, just as\r\n  the day was breaking.  I was amazed at what it looked\r\n  like there -- tall lush green hills rising from the\r\n  South China Sea.  A quick breeze thru the \"Transit\"\r\n  station, and we got some breakfast at a very nice cafe\r\n  in the airport.  Hong Kong is a very modern airport,\r\n  and had a ton of luxurious shopping.  It was like\r\n  South Coast Plaza, but without the May Company.\r\n   \r\n  A couple hours, and we were back on the same plane in\r\n  our same seats for the journey to Singapore.  I\r\n  happened to look out the window as we passed over Pnom\r\n  Penh.\r\n   \r\n  A word about the plane -- we flew Singapore Airlines. \r\n  WOW.  Lovely service, great seats (not too cramped),\r\n  and excellent in-flight entertainment -- there were 60\r\n  movies on demand, a hundred albums, and all the\r\n  Nintendo video games you could play.  Yeah, i was\r\n  playing Super Mario Brothers most of the way.\r\n   \r\n  So here we are in Singapore.  We have an 8 hour\r\n  layover, so we've booked a room in the \"Transit\r\n  Hotel\".  You can book rooms in hourly blocks (yeah,\r\n  seems sleazy).  So we went for a swim when we first\r\n  arrived, then took showers and cleaned up.  A fresh\r\n  change of clothes, then we went off for some\r\n  lunch/dinner.\r\n   \r\n  There are free internet terminals all over the airport\r\n  here -- a nice suprise.\r\n   \r\n  Three hours until our flight to Bangalore, so we'll\r\n  maybe catch a nap or just walk around this huge place.\r\n   \r\n  Until next time.....\r\n\n:title: Hello From Singapore\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  when i was 16, i had a 1977 VW Scirocco i raced with my dad in D\r\n  Street Prepared SCCA Solo II.  being young and poor, i\r\n  couldn't outfit the car to the maximum spec allowed\r\n  all at once.  so i saved and saved until i could come\r\n  up with the $500 or so for a set of Koni SAs -- the\r\n  end-all, be-all piece of hardware for me and my fellow\r\n  VW buddies.\r\n  \r\n  the Koni shocks for this car were externally\r\n  adjustable on the front (\"Firm->\" knob), but on the\r\n  rears you had to remove the shock, compress it fully,\r\n  twist to adjust it, then reinstall.\r\n  \r\n  when we went racing, i would crank those babies full\r\n  stiff.  the car on a smooth track on Yoko A-008 RSII's\r\n   would respond really quickly because there was pretty\r\n  much no suspension movement ;-).  we'd get to the\r\n  track early enough to do this procedure, since the 2\r\n  hour drive from the SF Bay Area to Crow's Landing\r\n  Naval Air Landing Field (where most of the events were\r\n  held) would not be fun in a car with essentially no\r\n  suspension.\r\n  \r\n  anyhow, went to an event, adjusted the schocks, did my\r\n  runs, worked the course for the rest of the day, and\r\n  was plum tuckered out in the afternoon.  it was a hot\r\n  day, and the last thing i wanted was to get under the\r\n  car to remove / adjust / replace the rear shocks for\r\n  the drive home.\r\n  \r\n  \"I'll just soften up the fronts\" i told myself.\r\n  \r\n  fateful mistake .... being a lazy teenager (which\r\n  leads to lazy adulthood, btw), i neglected to soften\r\n  up the rear shocks for an entire week after the event.\r\n   \r\n  \r\n  next comes a lesson in vehicle dynamics....\r\n  \r\n  driving home from my job selling \"furniture\" (sawdust\r\n  + glue + camlock hardware == furniture???) at the\r\n  local Home Express store, i spotted a friend on the\r\n  road up ahead in his trick 280Z and sped up to catch\r\n  up to him.\r\n  \r\n  rounding a nice 90-degree sweeping corner that i\r\n  enjoyed every time i went home from work, the car hit\r\n  a small bump about 1/2 way through the turn.\r\n  \r\n  the soft front handled it fine, but when the rears\r\n  went over the bump -- bounce!  the tires lost traction\r\n  for just enough time to send the rear of the car\r\n  swinging out wide.  oversteer in a FWD car -- what a\r\n  suprise ;-).\r\n  \r\n  countersteering, the rear hooked up again just in time\r\n  to send me straight into a fire hydrant on the side of\r\n  the road.\r\n  \r\n  the car stopped on top of the hydrant, and I heard a\r\n  loud thundering/hissing noise.  the rear of the car\r\n  began to lift into the air (honest).  i unlatched the\r\n  seatbelt and jumped (honest) out of the car and looked\r\n  back and saw the rear end about 1-2 feet off the\r\n  ground, water spraying furiously from under it.  the\r\n  car rolled forward off the column of water, and i took\r\n  off running for the nearest phone to call 911.\r\n  \r\n  the fire department came with several trucks, and\r\n  three police cruisers showed up too.  \r\n  \r\n  i walked back to the car just in time to see the a\r\n  fireman opening the car door and water just poured\r\n  out.  it must have been up to the window sills.  the\r\n  rear window was broken out and the windshield was\r\n  cracked in many places.  the pretty-good paintjob was\r\n  ruined -- the column of water had lifted all sorts of\r\n  gravel and rocks up with it, which all rained down on\r\n  the car.\r\n  \r\n  after it dried out, the car still ran and drove fine\r\n  -- i just needed to replace the glass that had broken,\r\n  i threw away the moldy carpet and rear seat, had the\r\n  moldy seats reupholstered, and i left the dented\r\n  bumper on the car as a reminder.\r\n  \r\n  i continued to run the car in Solo II, having lots of\r\n  fun with my stripped, \"full-race\" (to me -- remember,\r\n  i was 16) scirocco.  i ended up selling it for $400 to\r\n  a guy who never registered it, and drove it to Mexico\r\n  where it was later found abandoned -- neuspeed\r\n  suspension, 16v wheels, and schroth harness removed.\r\n  \r\n  -zs\r\n  \r\n  ps -- that was the 2nd fire hydrant i \"took out\".  the\r\n  first was when, 30 days after i got my license, i\r\n  rolled my dad's new car over a hydrant after\r\n  experimenting with excessive speed.  i'm lucky to\r\n  still be alive and to have not hurt any innocent\r\n  bystanders ;-).  no accidents since then!\r\n\n:title: Why it's bad to be dumb with Koni adjutable shocks\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  Today marks a milestone in the Nobot household.  It's\n  a red letter day around here.  Yes, today marks the\n  first day where the final CRT has been laid to rest.\n  \n  This process started a few years ago when I decided\n  that it was time to replace my old 17\" trinitron with\n  a flat panel display.  That was an *excellent*\n  decision.  The clarity of an LCD cannot be touched by\n  even the finest of CRTs.\n  \n  So the score:\n  CRT: 3 (arti's computer, work computer, TV)\n  LCD: 1 (zs computer)\n  \n  Soon after, my machine at work started looking waaaay\n  to fuzzy for its own good.  The final straw was when\n  we were reorganized into \"bullpens\", where three\n  people shared the space of two cubes.  I got the\n  \"middle\" spot, which left no room for a keyboard once\n  the 20\" CRT was placed on the meager desk space.  The\n  others in the cube were positioned in the corners, so\n  they had sqrt(2) times more depth than me for a\n  monitor.  \n  \n  I tried and tried to have work pay for an LCD for my\n  cube spot, but they wouldn't budge.  So I showed them\n  ;-) -- I bought a new LCD for home, and brought the\n  \"old\" one in to work on.  Haha ... suckers.\n  \n  Score:\n  CRT: 2 (arti computer, tv)\n  LCD: 2 (zs computer, work computer)\n  \n  We then decided to get a new computer for arti, and\n  subsequently traded monitors, since I was doing most\n  of my work at home on a laptop (with an LCD), so she\n  got the nice display.\n  \n  Score:\n  CRT: 2 (zs computer, tv)\n  LCD: 2 (arti computer, work computer)\n  \n  Working on the laptop in the living room was nice. \n  But then I got to thinking -- working on a GIANT LCD\n  in the living room would be even nicer!\n  \n  So out goes the TV set, in comes a 37\" LCD.  Oh yes.\n  \n  Score:\n  CRT: 1 (zs computer)\n  LCD: 3 (arti computer, work computer, tv)\n  \n  The final step in this saga came today.  After talking\n  with some old workmates, I learned of a new company\n  policy allowing those in bullpenned cubes to get LCD\n  monitors to compensate for the reduced desk space. \n  Off went my request to IS, and in came an \"official\"\n  LCD display for my work computer.  Back home went my\n  \"old\" LCD, and in the trash heap went the final CRT.\n  \n  Score:\n  CRT: 0\n  LCD: 4\n\n:title: Proud to be CRT Free\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

I suspect that they see the ways our culture diverges from the values that define fundamentalist Islam (sexual license, immodest dress, alcohol & drugs, secularism etc.) and fear that democracy and a free market will bring those same values to them and that their faith will become irrelevant. In any case, I fear that as long as we keep hitting them, without any avenue for finding out what\\x92s really driving them, we\\x92re in for more of the same. Dialogue isn\\x92t capitulation.\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:excerpt: \"\"\n:title: What of the Manners?\n:content: |-\n  OK, so it's been a while, I know.  But I'm back.  And I'm inspired.  And you know that is never a good thing.  As a daily-or-whenever-I-get-around-to-it, syndicated columnist for the nobot.chatterbox, I have a fiduciary (?) responsibility and more importantly, a readership starving for my Chronicles like a murder of Goth kids skulking out rumours on an internet chat site regarding the next installment of Lestat's adventures.  So, without further ado...\n  \n  \n  \n  It was Sunday the 12th September, and I was in a great mood.  I actually got up early for a Sunday, right around 13:00.  I had spent the majority of the prior night with friends at Svelte, the new buzz-teraunt in town.  Phenomenal Kobe beef burgers and seared Toro steaks, and oh yes, the Balvenie and Bordeaux were a-plenty.\n  \n  \n  \n  It was a pretty rude wake-up, as it was to the unbridled screaming of rabid, mendicant children running around the pool.  (For my loyal readership in the 'Outer Boroughs' of Orange County and the Fly-Over States, I live in an end-unit, right on the pool.  This has its advantages, such as a shorter walk thereto, the ability to collect 'intelligence' (if you can call it that) from my neighbors as they dump their minds as well as the contents of their bladders in the community hot-tub and my favorite, the Miami Vice blue glow I get at night in my upstairs bedroom from the pool lights.  Precious!)  But I digress...so, these fucking kids!  You know how two-to-four-year-olds repeat things when no one responds to the first twenty times they say something because it's mindless, short-sighted and retarded?  (Daddy, where's Joey?  Daddy, where's Joey?  Daddy, where's Joey?  Daddy, where's Joey?  Daddy, where's Joey?  Daddy, where's Joey?  Daddy, where's Joey?  Daddy, where's Joey?  Daddy,\n   where's Joey?  Daddy, where's Joey?  Daddy, where's Joey?  You get the point.)  If I want to hear repetitive nonsense like that, I'll listen to a DJ Shadow CD, thank you very much.  Well, this stupid two-to-four-year-old was running around the pool like an idiot, SCREAMING AND REPEATING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS: \"DADDY WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\".\n  \n  \n  \n  What on God's Green Earth could have been so important as to replicate my Nakamichi SoundSpace 3's discordant alarm function with such volume, pitch and clarity?  I opened my eyes, in truly Vampiric fashion, you know, kind of annoyed to be rattled out of slumber, but eager to feed?  Yeah, you got it.  So, with a sigh, I decided 13:15 was as good a time as ever to get out of bed and made my way to the closet to don just the right pair of Levi's Premium Skinners for my trek out to retrieve my Sunday Times (New York, 'natch) from my drive-way.  I love this morning ritual for a couple of reasons: (1) I look absolutely split in half when I wake up because I'm just a little dehydrated, but it's worth that first look in the mirror because I actually have an eight-pack and that makes me happy.  However, if I brought something home with me and it didn't have the good sense or taxi-fare to leave at four a.m. when we were done, inevitably, they want to go for another round after watching me\n   walk around the room.  \"Can't see it.  I have a big day.\"; rote response; (2) My neighbors notice and there is nothing better than making weak men feel even more insecure and knowing that, during some round of 'Married Convenience Sex', the wife, in between visions of Brad Pitt's Tristan in 'Legends of The Fall' and Jake Ryan in 'Sixteen Candles', I pop into her sad little consciousness and seal the deal.  Life is good when you have abs.  But I digress...\n  \n  So, after grabbing the paper, saying \"Hello\" to all of my female neighbors, and watching their approving reflections in my entry-way window as I walk back to the front door, I started in on brunch.  I started on the Week In Review section, and simultaneously filled my Bialleti three-cup stove-top espresso maker with Illy Caffe finely ground and sliced some nectarines and mangoes.  I believe in a balanced diet, so I also had one boiled egg and a corn tortilla to match.\n  \n  \n  \n  The day was actually full of promise; I continued to read the paper (I was on to the World Business section at this point, enjoying a most salient article on the future viability of Intel's CEO, Craig Barrett and another regarding the departure of embattled Michael Eisner from the Disney helm).  I moved on to the Magazine section, and therein was an article about raising polite children in a rude world or something like that.  This got me thinking: \n  \n  \n  \n  What ever became of manners?\n  \n  \n  \n  I guess that I should preface this analysis with my experiences in the previous two days which collectively formed the impetus for my query.  I'll start with Memphis on Friday night...\n  \n  \n  \n  It was a relatively quiet Friday evening, after a three day weekend and a four-day work week.  I ventured out at about 20:30 to Cafe Pascal for a quick glass of wine and a sunset.  I then called my brother to see if he wanted to meet up with me for a bite before getting on the wheels at Memphis at 22:00.  We agreed to meet up at 21:00 at Mother India to nosh some Naan.  While the decor at the M.I. is lacking, the food and service is always top-drawer.  Sean and I had about three Kingfishers, way too much food and good conversation about the business of clubs and bars in the Newport-mesa area.  We then left to make Memphis at 22:00.  Now bear in mind that I never show up to Memphis before 23:00.  But I went in with my brother, to see the dinner crowd still there, finishing up their chocolate bread pudding and whatever extra calories and fat they clearly did not need.  These people were simply moldy.  There were two long tables in particular that caught my discerning eye.  The first\n   was obviously a birthday party for a corpulent slob with an undersized Alkaline Trio t-shirt and shorts on.  The other was pre-bachelorette party dinner with what appeared to be a contest to see which attendant could have the most back-fat bubbling out of their Se7en Jeans like a home-made loaf of multi-grain bread.  Ghastly, really.  The bar-back, Cancho, saw me coming in and immediately set up a table in the back-yard, with four chairs, a candle and a clean ashtray.  OK, even though I'm out early like an amateur, I have a great table and a killer pour of Scotch in-hand.  So I sat, observing the idiocy, and taking solace in the fact that it would soon be moving on to The Lodge or The Shark Club, or some other bastion of low-class lunacy.  No such luck.\n  \n  \n  \n  As I sat there, enjoying a Dunhill Light, my second Oban (neat, of course) and my third Pellegrino, the crowd discernibly changed.  It became a sweaty sea of white blubber seeping out of low-rise jeans, beach bricks and men in shorts and trainers.  Fine, whatever.  But what came next is what really got me.\n  \n  \n  \n  I sat there, observing these people, their topics of conversation the semiotics of their costume choices, and wondering what their bathrooms looked like.  A pair of Mensa members (clad in what I believe is from the \"Carnival Cruiseline\" catalogue of shorts, camp shirts and those stupid, stupid all-terrain Teva sandal things.  For fuck's sake, it's after Labour Day, it's night-time, this ain't no barbecue, and we're not wind-surfing.  Why the hell are you dressed like that?) sat down at my table as though I was not there.\n  \n  \n  \n  Hmmm...\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  I asked them if they would like to join me and they looked at me as though I appeared out of the ether.  Now, I know my boyish good looks and preternatural charms occasionally have this effect in the right light, but this look was precious.  They actually did not realize that I was sitting there first.  Needless to say, they didn't answer and I didn't pry.  I didn't bother listening to their conversation, though I'm sure it was about \"going to Bed, Bath and Beyond tomorrow\" or something nearly as basal.  They obviously were unaccustomed to asking permission for anything, as was evident by the empowerment they obtained by ordering directly from the ship's catalogue and having it delivered to their doorstep before they even arrived home.  Oh, how liberating, to live each day as though you're on the top deck, shooting skeet and eating eclairs until your liver taps out!  Every day like a Jimmy Buffett song!  Oh sweet joy and hamburgers in Paradise!\n  \n  \n  \n  Morons.\n  \n  \n  \n  So these two fashionistas retrieved their Budweiser bottles and walked away about twenty minutes later; not a bad time I thought, and it's pissing me off enough to make me write.  I like that.  But then the real fun started.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  More guys in shorts.  The \"GQ\" members of the shorts-wearing clan were wearing those stupid, bold-striped, colorful Queer-Eye shirts.  OK, I wore these things three years ago and they were fun.  But when guys in West Texas are wearing them, it's time to let it go.  And ditch the sunglasses on the back of the head.  Buy a car, when the sun goes down, put the sunglasses in it.  Simple.\n  \n  \n  \n  I was now alone at the table, just how I like it.  At this point, I'm glad that I never show up before 23:00, because none of my crew apparently does either.  And now I know why my brother is in such a foul mood by the time I get there.  So, the funny guy in shorts comes over and puts his drink on my table.  Mistake #1.  This is my second worst pet peeve, just after the mis-use of the word \"your\".  Never, ever put your foul well vodka tonic or foul well gin 'n' tonic or foul well vodka Redbull on my table if you are not seated with me.  Mistake #2: walking away.  After subtly 'adjusting' the table a couple of times, I realized that I would not be able to dislodge the tonic-based tumor from my table, as it was placed pretty much dead-center.  So, as my friend decided to place his drink right next to my ashtray, and I had had soooooooooo much to drink already, I dropped a big, Sixteen Candles Grandma-sized ash in his drink.  I mouthed to myself, \"that's RENT, bitch.\"  My friend took his\n   drink away, never even noticing that he was imbibing the worst possible concoction this side of a German scheisse film.  And the world was balanced again.\n  \n  \n  \n  I was back to square one and I guess at this point, I should note a bit about my apparel choices for the evening.  I was wearing a black Prada fitted short-sleeved shirt that accentuated my biceps nicely.  I paired this with a pair of black Levi's Premium boot cut cords (button-fly, of course) and my usual black Prada motorcycle boots.  My accessory choices for the evening were pretty bling, but not over the top.  I did however; wear my new Omega Seamaster Chrono, with the very rare white face.  I topped it all off with a black military-inspired cap by Goorin.\n  \n  \n  \n  There was this couple seated to my left who had quite clearly been out on the lash since early afternoon.  They were accompanied by a good-natured, robust fellow who reminded me of John Rhys-Davies in Shogun or Raiders.  He was dancing to the summer hits and enjoying himself in his shorts, white trainers and abstract-patterned camp shirt.  The woman in the equation was very bored by the whole situation, but was presentable and arguably the best-dressed female in the joint at that time.  (Bear in mind, the rest of my crew had yet to arrive.)  I peripherally noticed that she was looking at my watch.  She slid over, put her arm around my neck and whispered into my ear with breath that reeked of an odd combination of well vodka gimlets, Camel lights, cheap Bolognese sauce and vomit, \"Are you having a good time?  What kind of watch is that?\"  I sighed, removed her arm, and said, \"First, let's be friends that don't touch.  Second, yes, I am beside myself with glee.  Third, it's a Casio\n   G-Shock Special Edition.  You can only get these in Burundi\"\n  \n  \n  \n  \"Wow, it's really pretty.  Do you have any mints?\"\n  \n  \n  \n  Good God almighty.  If there ever was a time to have a bottle of bleach and a wire barbecue brush out with your normal Friday night kit, this was it.  I said \"Unfortunately, no Ma Chere, I do not.\"  She whispered, into my cheek this time, perilously close to my lips, \"then what do you do to keep your breath fresh in situations like this...?\"  To which I replied, turned to my drink and said \"I drink more Scotch and encourage others to do the same.\", whilst removing her arm and face for a second time.\n  \n  \n  \n  At this point, I look briefly to my left and see that her male counterpart is watching, but not angry, or even surprised, for that matter.  But she excuses herself and makes her way inside.  Her male then says to me across the expanse, \"Dude, sorry about that.  She's my girlfriend.\"  I replied succinctly, \"Put a fucking leash on it.\"  He nodded.  Like a coward.\n  \n  \n  \n  I guess the rude-ness here goes unsaid, she's involved with this guy, not getting enough attention, and proceeds to try to throw her tongue down my gullet no more than two meters away from her supposed 'boyfriend'.  Lack of manners.  If you want it that bad, wait until next week, brush your teeth and come alone.  Simple.\n  \n  \n  \n  This comedy repeated itself all night; I actually left early, at about nine sheets to the wind.F\n  \n  \n  \n  The next day, Saturday, I was pretty excited as I was going to be getting my new Heavenly&reg; Mattress, which as all of you know, is the W hotel's signature mattress.  Ahhhhhh...sweet, sweet slumber.  So I went out to buy some new sheets at Macy's.  Since I have not purchased new sheets in about five years, I figured it was worth going full throttle and grabbing some high thread count sheets, a silk duvee cover and some decorative pillows.  I was putting my new bed-look together and this yippy, blonde, barnstormer comes up to me and immediately begins to violate my personal space.  And not in a cool European way, but in an \"I would love to demo one of these demo beds for you\" way.  Whatever.  So we start talking and she asks what my room looks like.\n  \n  \n  \n  God, please.\n  \n  \n  \n  I tell her that it's extremely minimal, all white walls except for the main wall behind my bed, which I had painted Ralph Lauren Stadium Red (look it up, it's very crowd-pleasing).  She about loses her panties at this point, and asks how I came up with the idea to do one red wall.  I admitted that it was kind of dumb, but still, cool...Mr. Big did it on Sex in the City.  The bra and boots were about to fly at this revelation.  \"OH MY GOD!!!  THAT IS SOOOO SEXY!!!!!!!!!!!  I HAVE TO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!\"  Yeah, right.  OK.\n  \n  \n  \n  Next, that idiotic question that every woman with absolutely no identity asks: \"Who do I remind you of on that show?\"  I had just enjoyed a phenomenal meal at the sushi bar at Kitayama about 45 minutes prior to coming into Macy's.  I didn't want to spray yellowtail, albacore and Japanese snapper all over this woman, but she was really pushing it.  I thought about it, crinkled my eyebrows and replied, \"Samantha\".  Ha ha ha ha ha!  You should have seen the immediate revulsion.  It didn't deter her though, and she said, \"No!  I'm Carrie Bradshaw!\"  Of course you are, ma chere, of course you are.\n  \n  \n  \n  So we took my choices up to the checkout stand, she rang them up and handed them to me.  As I walked away (by the way, she was so wound up in my charms that she hadn't realized yet that I had yet to pay the $957.92 for the densely-woven cotton and silk goods with which I was about to abscond.), she handed me her business card and offered her services \"in any way at all\" and commented pathetically that \"she has to see this room, in photos at least.\"  So I am half-way down the escalator when I hear her screaming, \"Michael!  You haven't paid for that stuff yet!\"  I feigned an incoming phone call and kept on my way, but she insisted on screaming louder (a la Daddy, Where's Joey?), so I acknowledged her with a sheepish smile and gestured that I would be right back up.  I paid and was on my way, with almost 1,000 more frequent flier miles in my UAL account.\n  \n  \n  \n  I'll admit, I was the one without manners there, but it was just reciprocity on my part.  She was annoying and obtuse.  I could have moved a lot faster and been a lot more clandestine, but I really didn't think she deserved to get fired over comparing herself to Carrie Bradshaw.\n  \n  \n  \n  So, I got to thinking...where have manners gone?  Why don't people say please, thank you and excuse me?  Why do people steal?\n  \n  \n  \n  I don't know, it just makes for a funny story, and it gives me a rare (?) chance to be a dick to people I don't know.\n  \n  \n  \n  Until next time, adieu.\n"

Malcontent about some torrid, tasteless mass sexual event (or was it Sexual Event Mass? Fucking Catholics.) she attended involving manila rope, cheese doodles, fly-paper and a metronome. I actually needed sleep evidently, and ended up rising at 15:00 PST.\n  \n  I threw on some pants, ('cause like Jack, \"I like sleepin' in the Nooood!\") and headed downstairs. No usual paper-retrieval antics this morning, not in the mood.\n  \n  I was pretty cooked last night, I met up with a couple of friends (I'll call them Nigella and Julia to protect the innocent) at Habana and we had tapas and lots of wine. Good times ensued.\n  \n  Good-Time Party Guy had to leave his car at Memphis last night because he suspected that he would probably have some trouble fitting the compact sports coupe into the two-car garage, without a high probability of peeling off both side mirrors, a tail-light and the door moulding. So I'm waiting for it to cool off outside so I can skate down the mile-or-so to retrieve my motor-coach.\n  \n  I was making \"breakfast\" (I guess it counts, it's the first meal of the day), and I needed some ambient noise in the living room to keep me company and to ward off some of the post-binge depression that inevitably follows a night of je ne sais quoi and joie de vivre. I couldn't see listening to anything on HBO or any of the other cable channels, I don't like news channels because I'm fucking sick of hearing about Hurricane Eyesore or whatever. So I went through my newly-arrived Netflix selections.\n  \n  -The Dancer Upstairs\n  -Dirty Pretty Things\n  -Sex and Lucia\n  and...\n  -Before Sunrise...\n  \n  Now I rented this film because I have not seen it in about five years, and I whole-heartedly wanted to see Before Sunset in the theater. However, I hate live music and I hate going to theaters even more. So, I'll wait to see it in a month or so, when it comes out on DVD. Anyway, I put it in the DVD player, turned on all the aural and visual electronic accoutrements and went back to preparing a lovely Croque Monsieur with sliced papaya (seasoned with lime, salt and Japanese Ichimi chili powder, 'natch). I also had three beverages, a short glass of organic blackberry juice, an espresso with turbinado sugar and a half-litre of Penta water (I was so dehydrated this morning that my piss looked like pus. But anyway...back to the movie.)\n  \n  I love pure dialogue movies. The subleties implied and expressed by Delpy and Hawke are amazing and authentic. And frankly, I don't think that I understood the movie the first time I saw it as I did this afternoon. (ArcAngel begs the question...)\n  \n  Why?\n  \n  There is a dance that people that are attracted to each other do when they meet On The Road. Savvy travelers do specifically. I think it has to do with watching your wallet, your travel docs and your backpack (or, in my case, a really stunning Tumi messenger bag in black ballistic nylon). You know you're going to get physical at some point, but you need to make sure there aren't any firearms, knives or PrimaCord and C-4 involved. Before Sunrise does the most amazing job of capturing the sublime mundity of the due diligence conversations conducted in the glorious pursuit of getting some \"En Tour\".\n  \n  I was watching the film, imagining myself back in HCMC, VietNam (Hi Lan), or The Recoleta, Buenos Aires (Victoria, tu eres una diablita), Edinburgh, Scotland (Hi Shannyn)...you get the message. The conversations I have had...good God...were all like the conversations in this movie at one point or another. Not to pull a \"Carrie Bradshaw\" or anything like that.\n  \n  Anyway, thought I would share a little bit of the downy side of this Seraphim's wings. Back to slicing up mother-fuckers. I am the sword of God after all.\n  \n  -ArcAngel\n  \n  \n"

We need that water\n  boiling!\n  \n  <li>Into the saucepan, pour in the olive oil.  Put the\n  heat on medium to medium high.  Get it hot -- but not\n  too hot -- and put in the garlic and oregano.  The\n  smell after 10 seconds should be making you REALLY\n  hungry.  If the garlic starts to burn, it's too hot. \n  Start over.\n  \n  <li>Once you've decided you're so hungry you have to\n  start snacking, put the onion and chopped jalapeno in\n  with the garlic.  Now that's livin'.  Let them mellow\n  in there for a while until the onion starts to soften\n  up, then pour in the can of diced tomatoes.\n  \n  <li>Put the heat under the sauce on medium, and stay\n  focused.  You want this sauce to cook down now -- the\n  flavors need to get to know each other, and with the\n  tomato water evaporating, things get more intense.\n  \n  <li>Into the skillet goes the sausage.  Get that pan\n  nice and hot -- no need to be nice to that meat.  The\n  crunchier the better.  \n  \n  <li>Now here's the secret: Put the bell pepper and\n  sliced mushrooms in the hot pan with the sausage.  Pay\n  attention to it and stir it around occasionally.\n  \n  <li>At some point, the water will start boiling.  Now\n  is a good time to cook your pasta.\n  \n  <li>Once the mushrooms in the sausage pan start to get\n  little singed edges, you know you're doing it right. \n  It's not long now.\n  \n  <li>95 seconds before you can't stand waiting any longer, mix the fresh basil into the now thick sauce.\n  \n  <li>Once the pasta is cooked to your liking, the sauce\n  is begging for mercy, and the sausage/bell pepper/mushroom\n  mixture looks like it's spent the day on the sun without any Coppertone, it's\n  time to put it all together and eat up.\n  \n  </ul>\n  \n  Personally, I like using spicy italian sausage, and\n  keeping the sauce fairly mild.  The jalapeno doens't\n  really add heat to the sauce as much as flavor.  If\n  you want things really hot, put some crushed red\n  pepper flakes in with the garlc in the beginning.\n\n"

It has\n  really morphed into a wonderfully user friendly and\n  beautiful website.  Excellent job.\n  \n  If I had a thought in my head that as worth putting\n  down on paper I suppose I would entertain the idea of\n  submitting something.  But in actual fact, my head is\n  so scrambled with bits of information flying about\n  here and there, I would probably make a good test\n  subject for the UCLA neuro-psychiatric institute.\n  \n  Witnesseth:\n  \n  1) My engagement party is on the 30th of October and\n  we would love it if you two would make it down.  Can\n  you give me your address?  \n  \n  2) My \"new\" 2001 Volvo V-40 has been driving like a\n  dream.  ( Don't give it a second thought that you\n  never called me back - really...  [<i>doh! --ed</i>])\n  \n  Anyway, one month after purchase, the 1.9 litre dual\n  stage turbo engine has been augmented by yours truly\n  and now deftly speeds down the by-ways of suburban San\n  Diego with a new EuroSport Ultra-Flo Air Intake\n  System.  check it:\n  <a href=http://www.eurosporttuning.com/home.htm>http://www.eurosporttuning.com/home.htm</a>\n  Sure it cost too much money - but what the hell.\n  \n  The new sucking, swirling, gurgling sound coming from\n  under the hood took some getting used to though.   I\n  actually thought a couple of times about reinstalling\n  the stock airbox becuase people were looking at me\n  like I was smuggling a troup of Swedish prostitutes\n  under the hood of my car.  But today she passed the\n  test (the car that is - sicko) as I hit the ol' pedal\n  to get around a truck that was killing my road-stoke. \n  The prostitutes made made one giant sucking, slurping,\n  swirling inhale and before I knew it, I was around\n  that semi in nothing flat.  Seriously though, I got\n  waaaay more response than I would have gotten from the\n  stock airbox.  Its pretty remarkable actually.   Not\n  only was I pressed into the back of the seat but I\n  looked down quickly enough to see my MPGs drop to 11.1\n  - Sweeeeeeet.  11.1 - isn't that the mileage of a 12\n  cylinder Ferrari?  \n  \n  Bottom line - She's a keeper.\n  \n  3) My security guards have been getting into trouble\n  at work.  Last week one guard was stoned on the job -\n  like eyes rolling in the back of his head stoned - I\n  couldn't believe it.  Franklin is his name - or was -\n  Franklin's ass was fired.  I mean fuck - I can get some\n  idiot to sit in front my properties and get stoned for\n  free - I don't need to pay him for it.  This week we\n  found another one was sleeping(asshole), another one\n  spit sunflower seeds around the entire\n  property(idiot), and another guard who was sleeping\n  after passing out drunk had to be woken up by a tenant\n  so he would move his camper shell pick-up truck out of\n  the tenants DRIVEWAY (speechless).\n  \n  Jesus H Christ Z - you've got to be fucking kidding\n  me.  I am now of the belief that security guards are\n  one notch up from sign spinners on Darwin's employment\n  ladder.  I have absolutely no faith in them anymore. \n  I just thank god mine aren't armed.\n  \n  4) Ms. Franklin contunes to call me at work.  \n  The 411:  \n  Ms. Franklin, an old tenant in one of my buildings,\n  claims she has bruises running up and down her shins\n  from some pipe fittings that apparently fell on her during\n  the period her crappy apartment complex in the hood\n  was getting converted to ridiculously overpriced\n  condominiums.  Ms. Franklin wants money for her supposed\n  doctor bill as well as money for her \"pain and\n  suffering\".  Ms. Franklin doesn't live in my building\n  anymore - she moved a way three months ago.  Ms. Franklin\n  has presented me with her medical examination form\n  that needs to be decyphered by an egyptian\n  cryptographer.  Ms. Franklin has no witnesses.  Ms. Franklin can kiss my ass.\n  \n  5) You'll appreciate this:  Doesn't one need to know\n  about computers to be in I.T.?  I asked the I.T. girl\n  at work today if she could go onto a computer and\n  enable some docs to be shared on our peer-to-peer\n  network.   The response I got was priceless:  With a\n  half cocked look of utter stupidity she stated the\n  follwing: \"Um...I don't know how to do that.  I'm more\n  of a department head than an actual IT person.\"  \n  \n  riiiiiiiight.  \n  \n  6) Debates:  I think Kerry has been smoking that idiot\n  like a pack of Kools.\n  \n  \n  See ya Z - More next time.\n  \n  I am the Walrus....\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  Saturday, Arti and I drove up to SF to check out some\n  art that some folks were showing as part of Open\n  Studios.\n  \n  This is a great event, and is held in a lot of places\n  around the country.  Artists interested in showing\n  their work register with the Open Studios\n  organization, who then includes them on their maps and\n  in their annual catalog.  Each artist is assigned a\n  \"weekend\" where their home / studio will be opened to\n  the public.  \n  \n  It's a great chance to discover new local talent, and\n  most of the time to actually speak with the artist\n  about his/her work.  This really adds personality to\n  artwork, which we usually only experience far far away\n  in space and time from the person who made it.\n  \n  Derek and Emily arranged for us to all go to the\n  \"Kick-off Party\" last Thursday, where we could look at\n  one small example piece from everyone involved.\n  \n  The SF Open studios is pretty fancy -- with a\n  full-color catalog produced every year.  On Friday\n  night, we went thru the catalog and put a star next to\n  the artists we were interested in.  Total of six for\n  this weekend, and a couple for next weekend.\n  \n  We saw some neat work, and ended up getting a couple\n  of pieces -- one from a guy we went to high school\n  with who is friends with Em and Mark.\n  \n  We saw some really cool photography (yes!  photography\n  that i liked!) from <a href=http://www.jeremieroux.com\n  />Jeremie Roux</a> (nighttime light and motion\n  studies) , <a href=http://www.rena-b.com/photo>Rena\n  Buchgraber</a> (industrial photo transparencies\n  mounted on brused aluminum) and from Damon Sneed\n  (digital mirror-manipulation; no web site yet).  Very\n  <a href=/pictures/20041002-nighttime/?9>inspiring</a>\n  stuff.\n  \n  Open Studios really presents a diverse body of work --\n  from things that I really dig, to things I think are\n  \"not art\" to (especially in SF) things that I'd put\n  squarely in the \"porno\" bin.\n  \n  And this really hammers home an important point:  Art\n  is <b>personal</b>.  Anyone who tells you \"this is\n  art\" or \"that is crap\" or \"you don't know art\" doesn't\n  know what's up.  Something is art when you have an\n  emotional reaction to it.  The lack of a reaction to\n  something made skillfully puts that something into the\n  \"craft\" bucket.\n  \n  But here's the deal -- one man's craft (or porno for\n  that matter) is another man's masterpiece.  Art is all\n  about YOU.  Don't see the point in why Picasso is\n  highly regarded, well no big deal!  It's not art to\n  you!  However, maybe after learning about why others\n  hold his work in high regard, your feelings may\n  change, and you may see things in the work you didn't\n  see before.  Great!  You have new art!\n  \n  It's rare for me to feel something from photography. \n  Photography is a tricky medium -- since the barrier to\n  entry is quite low (unlike painting or music),\n  photography-as-art for me is difficult to come by. \n  Most things I see in museums are nice portraits,\n  landscapes, or candid \"moment frozen in time\" type\n  journalism shots.  For me, these are good\n  demonstrations of either photography as <b>craft</b>\n  and/or good luck.\n  \n  However, innovative artists like those I mentioned\n  above, who combine mastery of their craft, creative\n  impulses, and who do it in a manner I like -- well,\n  now  that's what I call art.\n  \n  So I picked up some good inspiration this weekend from\n  the work I saw, and took the camera out a couple of\n  nights.  There are a <a\n  href=http://nobot.2y.net/pictures/india_art/>few</a>\n  <a\n  href=http://nobot.2y.net/pictures/20041002-nighttime/>new</a>\n  <a\n  href=http://nobot.2y.net/pictures/20041004-grasshopper/>photo</a>\n  <a\n  href=http://nobot.2y.net/pictures/20041004-baynight/>galleries</a>\n  to look at as a result.\n\n:title: Rambles On Art and Photography\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  Over the course of the last nine days, we have doubled\r\n  the amount of artwork we have in our display cache at\r\n  home.  Not only have we been blessed with a lovely\r\n  three-years-late wedding gift from my lovely mom, but\r\n  there has been much photography going on here, as well\r\n  as it being the time for Open Studios in San\r\n  Francisco, where folks like us can get neat stuff on\r\n  the cheap!\r\n  \r\n  Here are the stories....\r\n  \r\n  1) Mom painted us a vibrant colorful swimming pool in\r\n  the AM scene.  I don't think she named it, so in that\r\n  case, I hereby decree that it is \"Swimming Pool in the\r\n  AM\".  Hopefully she has thought of something\r\n  more clever!  <i>[update 20041012 -- the official name is \"Swimming in the Sunrise\".  Mom's name is definitely better!]</i>  It is the one up on the purple wall --\r\n  the only wall in the house that did not cower in fear\r\n  from her use of the brightest colors available to\r\n  Mankind.  We really love it Ma!\r\n  \r\n  2) Last weekend, we stopped by one \"T. Ito\"'s studio\r\n  space.  His work in the Open Studios catalog was\r\n  compelling, hence the visit.  Little did I know that\r\n  this was Trevor Ito -- we went to high school\r\n  together, were in the same photo class, and he was\r\n  good buds with Em and Mark and went to their wedding. \r\n  Small world, great work.\r\n  \r\n  3) Arti fell in love with these aspens silkscreened\r\n  onto 8x8 inch wood boxes painted different colors.  I\r\n  like them too!\r\n  \r\n  4) As I mentioned before, I've been inspired to take a\r\n  new direction in photos.  This inspiration came from\r\n  some work we saw in SF Open Studios.  The\r\n  possibilities are never-ending.  Lots of photography\r\n  happening around here these days.  I'll have some cool\r\n  stuff to show off here in the next week or so.\r\n  \r\n  5) This past weekend was a rollercoaster of Open\r\n  Studios.  The beginning was awesome -- our first stop\r\n  was to Kitty Wehrmeister's house.  She works in monoprint\r\n  (Paint is applied to an un-etched plate, paper laid on\r\n  top, then passed through a press.  Repeat as many\r\n  times with as many colors as necessary.)  Her work was\r\n  fabulous -- and at $25-$35 per print, this really blew\r\n  out the Value Ratio scale.  We got two of her prints.  They are now awaiting frames.\r\n  \r\n  [btw, after Kitty's place, we spent WAAAAAAY too long\r\n  at this bizarre \"I doodle in sharpies on 3x5 cards and\r\n  sell my work for $500 and by the way have you looked\r\n  at this rainbow doodle in 3D glasses and by the way\r\n  this only cost me $0.05 to produce so I'm making over\r\n  $60 per hour with my art and by the way this is the\r\n  cosmic hearth where the space between you and I comes\r\n  from and by the way look at the little metallic stars\r\n  in this one and by the way there are only $0.01 worth\r\n  of glitter in this one so I could maintain my profit\r\n  margin and by the way.....\" \r\n  AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!]\r\n  \r\n  6) Saturday's Open Studios viewing extravaganza ended\r\n  at <a href=http://www.baseart.com/>Base Gallery</a> --\r\n  BJ's badass gallery/studio space where I spent many\r\n  nights DJing gallery openings and learning how to draw\r\n  people in their drop-in figure drawing class.  We saw\r\n  Catherine St. Clair there (she used to help us out in\r\n  the figure drawing) and her cool work.  We really\r\n  liked this one painting she had done 5 years ago, so\r\n  we got it.  Had a great talk with her New Husband Beau\r\n  about photography.  Too bad BJ wasn't there!\r\n  \r\n  So that's it!  We have had great fun re-arranging (and\r\n  seeing again) the stuff we had up before consuming\r\n  this cornucopia of art.  That reminds me:  Move the\r\n  stuff on your walls around at least every 6 months. \r\n  It's amazing how we no longer see what is hanging up\r\n  when they've been there for so long.\n:title: Work Work Work Work Work Work\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

Thought to myself that it's as good of\n  a place as any if you want to keep something like that\n  around.  Maybe there is some kind of recycling\n  facility here.  Lots of trash and stuff strewn about\n  too.\n  \n  My intention here was to build a music broadcaster. \n  There were other broadcaster machines here among the\n  junk.  I knew there weren't any other people here.  It\n  was kind of neat to be the only person here, but to\n  see the evidence that I was definitely not the first\n  person here.  That made it feel more comfortable I\n  think.\n  \n  Walked down the steps from the metal door, and thought\n  for a second that I wouldn't be able to breathe, since\n  I was on the Moon and all.  I inhaled, the air was a\n  bit thick and odorous (like Egypt was), but there was\n  air was there.  I assumed that the folks who had come\n  before me had set up some kind of atmosphere generator\n  or some sort of bubble to keep in the air.  This place\n  was a lot like the desert on earth, but I was indeed\n  \"on the Moon\".  \n  \n  Anyhow, I carried on with my mission...\n  \n  There was a turntable waiting for me at the bottom of\n  the steps, record spinning.  I placed the needle onto\n  the vinyl, and a lovely dance song I'd never heard\n  before played from the speakers nearby.  It rocked. \n  Mission accomplished.  There would now be my music\n  broadcast from the Moon.\n  \n  Time to go back.\n  \n  I went back up the steps, thru the door into the metal\n  room, and sat down on a small couch.  I immediately\n  got up, opened the metal door, and went out into what\n  I guess was my house back on Earth.\n  \n  I looked out the window into the night sky, and saw\n  the moon big and yellow; half of it showing above the\n  horizon.  I walked out onto the deck and pointed the\n  antenna out there at the Moon as rose completely above\n  the mountains in the distance.  Sure enough, the music\n  I had started playing on the Moon played on the stereo\n  inside the house.  I thought to myself, \"now anyone on\n  Earth can listen to this as long as they can see the moon\".\n\n:title: Off-Earth / On-Moon\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

It has\r\n  been doing a good job of being both a TV and a\r\n  computer monitor for a few months now.  But its\r\n  untapped Hi-Def capabilities have been disrupting my\r\n  sleeping patterns (see the previous article).\r\n  \r\n  I've been casually looking at our options in the HD\r\n  world.  Here they are at the moment:\r\n  \r\n  * Dish Network HD package<br/>\r\n   - pros: cheap addition to our current bill<br/>\r\n   - cons: not many channels, $1000 for the HD PVR\r\n  \r\n  * Comcast Cable HD<br/>\r\n   - pros: many channels, especially FSBA HD (the local FOX Sports station that broadcasts SF Giants games in HD)<br/>\r\n   - cons: no PVR available\r\n  \r\n  * VOOM<br/>\r\n   - pros: many channels, not expensive<br/>\r\n   - cons: no PVR, no local sports channel\r\n  \r\n  * HD TiVo<br/>\r\n   - pros: HD PVR<br/>\r\n   - cons: still need to buy programming, expensive,\r\n  non-native data storage format\r\n  \r\n  So nothing really looks like a good option.  It's all\r\n  expensive ($1000 for any solution involving a PVR),\r\n  and none of them are ideal.\r\n  \r\n  Last week, I saw an article that covered a new product\r\n  from ATI called the \"<a href='http://www.ati.com/products/hdtvwonder/index.html'>HDTV Wonder</a>\".  It's a sub-$200\r\n  PCI card that serves as a HD and conventional TV tuner\r\n  / capture card.  It advertises some PVR-like\r\n  capabilities, and comes with a small indoor HD\r\n  antenna.  I figured for $200, I'd give it a shot..\r\n  \r\n  I was already going to <a\r\n  href='http://www.centralcomputer.com/'>Central\r\n  Computer</a> to get a small 5 port switch today\r\n  (another <a href='http://slimdevices.com/'>SliMP3</a>\r\n  needed hooking up), and happened to notice they had an\r\n  HDTV Wonder in stock.  No time like the baseball\r\n  playoffs / World Series to give in to some impulse purchases.\r\n  \r\n  After I got it home, I saw that it requires that yoiu have a video card with at least 64 MB of RAM. \r\n  Mine had 32MB, so back to Central Computer for the El\r\n  Cheapo video card Du Jour.  I returned with a GeForce\r\n  FX5200 based card with 128MB of ram -- for $60.\r\n  \r\n  Hooked it all up while the Astros/Cardinals game was\r\n  going on.  I was working quickly to try to catch a\r\n  glimpse of HD before it was over.  No such luck -- I\r\n  couldn't get the local FOX station tuned with the\r\n  included antenna.  Of course, no problemo at all\r\n  getting the Telemundo and Univision stations (the\r\n  spanish language stations have all the dough -- they\r\n  can afford to place a satellite over every persons\r\n  home and car!).  \r\n  \r\n  After half an hour of running through the \"Auto Tune\"\r\n  channel discovery feature of the ATI software several\r\n  times to try to get the FOX station (with the baseball\r\n  game), I decided to try a different antenna.  Over to\r\n  the 'Shack to see what they had.  Dropped another $50\r\n  on an amplified dish-shaped HTDV antenna, brought it\r\n  home, and hooked it up.  \r\n  \r\n  It sucked even worse than the simple antenna that\r\n  was included in the tuner card's box.  It's going back\r\n  to the 'Shack tomorrow.\r\n  \r\n  Back to the original free antenna.  This time I decided to try a high quality coax cable to connect it to the tuner card.  This made a HUGE difference!  The cable that comes with it is the push-on style and pretty thin and flimsy.  I used a cable that we got from a Comcast installation of days past -- with nice screw-on ends and heavy gauge wire.  The signal strength of every channel seemed to double.  \r\n  \r\n  When I went to the channel list screen to confirm my hunch of a better signal (there's a signal strength meter on that screen), the local FOX channel had magically appeared.  All right!  Now we're in business.\r\n  \r\n  I tuned in the\r\n  NBC station in time to see some of ER in HD.  Now\r\n  we're talking!  I didn't expect HD to be this good.  Watched that slack-jawed for a while.  Then Jay Leno came on.  \r\n  \r\n  Compare these two screen grabs to see the difference between regular TV and HDTV (why doesn't anyone have something like this online already?!?!?!):: \r\n  \r\n  <table><tr><td>\r\n    <a href='/blog_images/sdtv.jpg'><img src='/blog_images/sdtv_small.jpg' alt='click to enlarge'/></a>\r\n  </td><td>\r\n    <a\r\n  href='/blog_images/hdtv.jpg'><img src='/blog_images/hdtv_small.jpg' alt='click to enlarge'/></a>\r\n  </td></tr>\r\n  <tr><th>Regular TV</th><th>HDTV (1080i)</th></tr></table>\r\n  \r\n  Holy\r\n  Crap!!!  Sweet Tapdancin Mother of Broadcasting!!!  \r\n  \r\n  So for $260, I think I have something that fits the bill.  There is\r\n  lots more HD on cable / satellite, but I think I'll\r\n  wait until their PVRs are less expensive before making\r\n  a move that way.\r\n  \r\n  One other thing to note ... DTV (digital TV) hasn't really gotten much mention that I've heard.  DTV is standard definition TV but broadcast digitally, so there is no interference or static.\r\n  \r\n  HTDV stations broadcast in DTV when they don't have HD content to show.  DTV on the ATI card is head and shoulders better than the signal that comes from the Dish Network box.  It's sharper, the colors are truer, and the audio is clearer and less compressed.  \r\n  \r\n  Here's another comparison:\r\n  \r\n  <table><tr><td>\r\n    <a href='/blog_images/sdtv2.jpg'><img src='/blog_images/sdtv2_small.jpg' alt='click to enlarge'/></a>\r\n  </td><td>\r\n    <a\r\n  href='/blog_images/dtv.jpg'><img src='/blog_images/dtv_small.jpg' alt='click to enlarge'/></a>\r\n  </td></tr>\r\n  <tr><th>Regular TV</th><th>DTV (480i)</th></tr></table>\r\n  \r\n  So you heard it here first -- DTV is cool too.\n:title: HDTV Experiment\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

They figure a generally good-spirited, optimistic and oblivious public will take the benefit of the doubt every time, regardless of the curious lack of transparency and goodwill involving how they deal with their competition.\\n \\n\\\n  However, no one in their right, cognitive, critical mind is fooled, not even the ever-lucid and refreshingly un-anchored (pun intended) Walter Cronkite (see below).\\n \\n\\\n  What became of the Iran-Contra scandal started out as an annoying, crackpotted conspiracy theory, until someone \\\"viable\\\" leaked some info to a then-receptive, dignified national press.  The theory that \\\"the CIA may very well have replaced a democratically elected Prime Minister in Iran with the tepid Shah\\\" was considered revisionism at best, and looney conspiracy theory at worst, for over 40 years.  However, those that coordinated a Revolution in 1979 in Iran apparently believed it as gospel, as did Secretary of State Madeleine Albright when she admitted as much on 3-19-2000.\\n \\n\\\n  Pretty soon, at the pace that this administration and its pedestrian machinations are unravelling, just about every solid investigative reporter, author or social scientist will be deemed a \\\"conspiracy theorist\\\" by those who've publicly replaced Madison with Machiavelli.\\n \\n\\\n  Spare us, please.  The modern American Right does not have a monopoly on the Truth.  In fact, the disturbingly regular and defensive calls of \\\"conspiracy theory!\\\" coming from the Right ... are, on the whole, starting to resemble one big conspiracy theory from the Right.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n  ---------------------------------\\n\\n\\\n  REVIEW & OUTLOOK\\n\\n\\\n  The Plots Thicken\\n\\n\\\n  \\\"The most trusted man in America\\\" becomes a conspiracy theorist.\\n\\n\\\n  When Walter Cronkite talked on CNN last month about Osama bin Laden's scary pre-election video, yet another cat leapt out of the conspiracy-theory bag. \\\"I'm a little inclined to think,\\\" Mr. Cronkite told host Larry King, \\\"that Karl Rove, the political manager at the White House, who is a very clever man, he probably set up bin Laden to this thing.\\\"\\n\\\n  It's not clear whether this was a tasteless joke or a stray filament of wishful thinking; Mr. King probed no further. Yet the comment was a reminder that conspiracy theorizing--formerly confined to the realms of alien abduction kooks and grassy-knoll debaters--is edging ever closer to the mainstream. Like it or not.\\n\\\n  While the most notable examples now appear to be election-inspired and coming from the left, the direction may not be that significant. Experts who study conspiracy phenomena tend to agree on one thing: that at any given time people whose party is out of power are the most receptive to theories--about computer hackers in Florida, mind-controlling pro-Bush psychics, Osama \\\"October Surprises\\\"--that address their frustrations. In fact, the majority of all conspiracy theories seem to grow out of a sense of helplessness. The particular impulse that gave birth to a Web article like \\\"Royal Conspiracy: Princess Diana Names Her Killer\\\" by Uri Dowbenko may be wacko. Yet who can fault ordinary people who would prefer an explanation featuring palace assassins over a verdict that underlined the randomness of cruel fate?\\n\\\n  Yasser Arafat probably wasn't poisoned, but it's no surprise if perpetually discombobulated Palestinians want to think he was. The otherwise lucid actor Will Smith has espoused the belief that AIDS is part of a plot to strike down black people. That's a classic example, says Tim Melley, the Miami University (Ohio) professor who wrote \\\"Empire of Conspiracy: The Culture of Paranoia in Postwar America.\\\" Many conspiracists function like sociologists at first, he notes, \\\"identifying patterns of inequity . . . that have effects on society\\\"--and then they jump to blame everything on a deliberate plan. \\\"It's comforting. It provides an explanation that explains why your group is down and out.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n  Mr. Melley suspects that whatever form conspiracy theories take, they'll be intruding more into our consciousness in the future. For better or worse, he says, the major media are losing their authority as arbiters of the truth. The proliferation of alternative news sources on the Web and talk radio, for instance, reflects and feeds the notion that what the media powers-that-be are telling us is not the real story. Add to that the bombardments of ubiquitous advertising, and you get what Mr. Melley calls \\\"agency panic,\\\" where \\\"people are worried about their own ability to control themselves, worried that someone has gotten into their head and manipulated their desire.\\\"\\n\\\n  So far, most Americans still have an internal meter that instantly registers the difference between questions worth exploring and questions, like Mr. Cronkite's, that are coming from places they definitely don't need to visit. University of Florida law professor Mark Fenster, the author of \\\"Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture,\\\" has detected almost no belief in various 9/11 conspiracy scenarios. And many of the election-period charges, he says, can be attributed to normal \\\"partisan political rhetoric.\\\"\\n\\\n  If that's true, a lot of the disorienting plot chaff should begin to disappear soon from plain view. Screeching about the liberal media conspiracy or the Perpetual Hidden Government now headed by Mr. Bush and his international co-conspirators should recede back into the Web. There, at least, the exposure to \\\"agency panic\\\" is voluntary. \\n\\n\\\n  Copyright \\xA9 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst and provide for it.\\n \\n\\\n  - Patrick Henry\\n\\n\\\n  \\t\\t\\t\\n\\\n  ---------------------------------\\n\\\n  Do you Yahoo!?\\n Check out the new Yahoo!

  data: "--- \n:excerpt: \"\"\n:title: Perspective on economic and political trends facing America\n:content: \"\\n\\\n  Paul Krugman is one of my favorite writers and thinkers.  Others from the discipline of Economics, or from global finance, include George Soros, Robert Reich, Jeffrey Sachs and Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen.  They all agree with Krugman's macro-concerns right about now.\\n\\n\\\n  I just read Krugman's article below while scribbling in its margins.  I attach my comments, along with some other articles below, as hopefully useful primers.  I draw a brief, albeit crude, connection between the ideologies driving Neoconservatism in America's current political landscape with the Monetarism and Market Fundamentalism driving its economic one.  Keen comments, as always, are welcome.\\n\\n\\\n  Reuters article on Krugman's statements:\\n \\n\\\n  http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=6888422\\n\\n\\\n  Article excerpts and my comments:\\n \\n\\\n  > BANANA REPUBLIC?\\n\\\n  > \\n\\\n  > \\\"So if you ask the question do we look like\\n\\\n  > Argentina,\\n\\\n  > the answer is a whole lot more than anyone is quite\\n\\\n  > willing to admit at this point. We've become a\\n\\\n  > banana\\n\\\n  > republic.\\\"\\n\\n\\\n  We're not at where Argentina was 3 years ago (or\\n\\\n  Mexico, or the Pacific Rim nations, etc. before them)\\n\\\n  due primarily to the fact that WE control the bank (so\\n\\\n  far).  The world runs on the dollar standard -- hence\\n\\\n  we can run up massive deficits under the current\\n\\\n  post-WWII global economic structure and not worry\\n\\\n  about 'default' because the world inherently trusts in\\n\\\n  the word and sanctity of the US government to back up\\n\\\n  its Dollar Hegemony.\\n\\n\\\n  However, we've reached a breaking point and are\\n\\\n  allowing the dollar to drop in value as the main way\\n\\\n  of staying competitive (rather than through the\\n\\\n  strength of exports alone).  The gig is up, the world\\n\\\n  knows it, and so do our central bankers.  The American\\n\\\n  people, however, by and large do not.\\n\\n\\\n  > Crisis might take many forms, he said, but one key\\n\\\n  > concern is the prospect that Asian central banks may\\n\\\n  > lose their appetite for U.S. government debt, which\\n\\\n  > has so far allowed the United States to finance its\\n\\\n  > twin deficits.\\n\\\n  > \\n\\\n  > A deeper plunge in the already battered U.S. dollar\\n\\\n  > is another possible route to crisis, the professor\\n\\\n  > said.\\n\\n\\\n  The points raised in the two sentences above are\\n\\\n  related.  The US government is allowing the dollar to drop\\n\\\n  because of its massive trade and account deficits,\\n\\\n  which in turn are also symbiotic.  We can't fill in\\n\\\n  our trade deficits by matching the exporting power of\\n\\\n  our key foreign creditors (China, Japan, South Korea,\\n\\\n  Germany, et al.) so we drop the dollar to make our\\n\\\n  exports cheaper and more appealing abroad.  This is\\n\\\n  self defeating, as we then make our dollar less\\n\\\n  attractive for these very same longstanding creditors\\n\\\n  to the US.  Krugman intimates this below in\\n\\\n  referencing the Reserve Bank of China:\\n\\n\\\n  > The absence of any mention of currencies in a\\n\\\n  > communique from the Group of 20 rich and emerging\\n\\\n  > market countries this past weekend only reinforced\\n\\\n  > investors' perception that the United States, while\\n\\\n  > saying it promotes a strong dollar, is willing to\\n\\\n  > let its currency slide further.\\n\\n\\\n  I.E. We are cornered, fiscally speaking.  Many would\\n\\\n  argue that we are at war to preserve the Dollar\\n\\\n  Hegemony in trade and energy because we (seemingly)\\n\\\n  have little other choices.\\n \\n\\\n  > \\\"The break can come either from the Reserve Bank of\\n\\\n  > China deciding it has enough dollars, thank you, or\\n\\\n  > from private investors saying 'I'm going to take a\\n\\\n  > speculative bet on a dollar plunge,' which then ends\\n\\\n  > up being a self-fulfilling prophecy,\\\" Krugman\\n\\\n  > opined.\\n\\\n  > \\\"Both scenarios are pretty unnerving.\\\"\\n\\n\\\n  Such speculators may very well include people like\\n\\\n  Warren Buffett, George Soros, various English and\\n\\\n  European barons, Saudi billionaires like Prince\\n\\\n  Al-Walid bin Talal and Khalid bin Mahfouz, or more importantly, \\n\\\n  institutional investors.\\n \\n\\\n  Buffett already proclaimed months ago that he'd had it with the dollar:\\n\\n\\\n  http://www.fortune.com/fortune/specials/2003/1110/buffett.html\\n\\n\\\n  http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,1164319,00.html\\n\\n\\\n  Again, these are *capitalists* who are shying from the\\n\\\n  dollar.  Makes one think of Lenin's old statement: \\n\\\n  \\\"Sell them enough rope and capitalists will hang\\n\\\n  themselves\\\".\\n \\n\\\n  > In the longer-term, Bush's version of social\\n\\\n  > security reform, which Krugman says would relegate >\\n\\\n  pensions for the elderly to the whims of volatile \\n\\\n  > financial markets, could have wide-ranging \\n\\\n  > implications for\\n\\\n  > future generations.\\n\\\n  > \\n\\\n  > The only bright spot in having Bush in power for\\n\\\n  > another four years, said Krugman, is that further\\n\\\n  > economic mismanagement might trigger some sort of\\n\\\n  > popular outcry.\\n\\n\\\n  Here we come full circle.\\n\\n\\\n  This chance of a \\\"popular outcry\\\" is precisely why\\n\\\n  Neoconservatives are in power.  Upon extended review,\\n\\\n  one would sense strongly that those who have for years\\n\\\n  anticipated the imminent fiscal blowback, including\\n\\\n  those running our Federal Reserve banking system,\\n\\\n  'gave their blessings' for the Neocons to take power\\n\\\n  and prevent any such popular uprising.\\n\\n\\\n  This route of policy descends ultimately from the\\n\\\n  Federal Reserve system and our banks, not from the\\n\\\n  Bush administration, who are only the enforcers. \\n\\\n  Thus, Neoconservative political ideology and\\n\\\n  Monetarist economic ideology (what drives central\\n\\\n  banking in the US), like their origins in Straussian\\n\\\n  and Ayn Randian thought, go hand in hand.\\n\\n\\\n  > \\\"I do believe at some point there is going to be a\\n\\\n  > popular tidal wave against what has happened,\\\"\\n\\\n  > concluded Krugman. \\\"In the meantime, you keep\\n\\\n  > banging\\n\\\n  > on the drum, you keep telling the truth.\\n\\\n  > \\n\\\n  > \\\"And then eventually we have the great\\n\\\n  > demonstrations,\\n\\\n  > which I think are important to let the government\\n\\\n  > know\\n\\\n  > that many Americans are not happy with what is\\n\\\n  > happening,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\n  I.E. Economics drives politics.\\n\\n\\\n  When a nation's underlying economic paradigm (which in\\n\\\n  our case is \\\"Market Fundamentalism\\\", as labeled by\\n\\\n  Soros, Stiglitz and others), contains too many\\n\\\n  \\\"internal contradictions\\\", as attested to by George\\n\\\n  Soros and John Kay (Oxford economist), it is bound\\n\\\n  either for serious, painful reform, or for collapse. \\n\\\n  The latter scenario, in turn, can lead to centralized\\n\\\n  authoritarian government, whether it has a \\\"socialist\\\"\\n\\\n  stamp on it, or a \\\"fascist\\\" stamp.  History shows this\\n\\\n  to be true, repeatedly and consistently.\\n\\n\\\n  Witness, then, our current political infrastructure,\\n\\\n  which is devolving towards further authoritarianism --\\n\\\n  a general trend which will invariably result in\\n\\\n  replete centralization once the dollar collapses.\\n\\n\\\n  The following articles originated in mainstream press:\\n\\n\\\n  http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/112104D.shtml\\n\\n\\\n  http://www.indybay.org/news/2004/10/1697702.php\\n\\n\\\n  http://money.cnn.com/2004/01/27/commentary/bidask/bidask/index.htm\\n\\n\\\n  http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?siteid=mktw&dist=nwhpf&guid=%7B6C8D4585%2DE562%2D4E68%2DB446%2D058FDDB0ACA9%7D\\n\\n\\\n  http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/bergsten0904.htm\\n [detailed yet authoritative view.

The City is perceived as dripping with a faster pace, more \\\"danger\\\" due to the unknowns of erratic diversity, 'unplanned housing', prettier people, higher parking, valet and general living costs -- all perceived curiously, persistently and tragically as provisioning \\\"culture\\\" by suburban dwellers.\\n \\n\\\n  Based on the above, and ultimately, the suburbs can thus present a faux sense of ease, because the underlying values they promote urge its younger, restless residents to strive for city living while also subconsciously warning them of the risks involved.  One is presented with the seeming dilemma of wishing to naturally tap one's ambitions, yet not risking much of what one has retained.

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  What a trip!  We returned from our Ecuador / Galapagos vacay\r\n  yesterday.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=http://nobot.2y.net/pictures/20041225-galapagos/>Pictures\r\n  Here</a>\r\n  \r\n  Here's a synopsis:\r\n  \r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li><b>Sunday, 12/19 :: Depart for Quito, Ecuador</b> - We flew\r\n  with Pardis and Nick from SFO to Houston, then on to Quito,\r\n  lugging carry-on bags up a flight of stairs, we all realized that\r\n  9,300 feet is REALLY high. \r\n  Arti and I met up with very friendly person\r\n  from <a href=http://www.galapagosvoyage.com/home.asp>Metropolitan\r\n  Touring</a> in baggage claim who took us to our <a\r\n  href=http://www.swissotel.com/>Hotel</a>.  Say good-night to\r\n  Pardis and Nick who made arrangements in a different hotel.\r\n  \r\n  <li><b>Monday, 12/20 :: Arrival in the Galapagos</b> - We got up\r\n  early, eat breakfast in the room, and headed out to the Quito\r\n  airport to fly to the Galapagos with a friendly representative of\r\n  Metropolitan Touring.  After 40 minutes in the air, the plane made \r\n  a stop <a href=http://nobot.2y.net/blog_images/simon_harris.jpg>Simon\r\n  Bolivar</a> airport in Guyaquil -- the largest city in Ecuador\r\n  (population 3 million, elevation 50 feet) then continued on for\r\n  the 90 minute flight to Baltra Island (a decomissioned US Air\r\n  Force base) in the Galapagos.  We deplaned, met up with another\r\n  friendly reprasentative of Metropolitan Touring, then took a 30\r\n  minute bus ride to the other end of Baltra Island.  We hopped on a ferry\r\n  for the 5 minute ride to Santa Cruz Island, then got on another\r\n  bus to take us on the 1 hour journey to Puerto Ayora, on the\r\n  other side of the island.\r\n  \r\n  This bus ride was very interesting -- the road goes straight\r\n  across the island from the north to the south end.  The boat dock\r\n  where we got on the bus was dry and arid -- the only vegetation\r\n  were cactii and a leafless tree called Palo Santo.  As we proceed\r\n  across the island, the elevation increases (the Galapagos were\r\n  formed by volcanic activity, so they are in essence a series of\r\n  volcanos), and things get greener and wetter.  Near the halfway\r\n  point, it was raining, and the vegetation resembeled a jungle.\r\n  This was after only 20 minutes of driving.  After crossing the\r\n  halfway point, we started descending back to sea level, and things\r\n  got drier again.\r\n  \r\n  We got off the bus in Puerto Ayora near a dock, where a small\r\n  boat was waiting to take us and our stuff across a little harbor\r\n  to the path that led to our hotel.  There aren't any roads near\r\n  the Finch Bay Hotel, so the water taxi is the only means of\r\n  getting to and from town.\r\n  \r\n  Along the path to the hotel, we were given quite a suprise when we\r\n  saw a large male Marine Iguana, four or so smaller females, and\r\n  several juvinile iguanas sunning themselves on a stone wall.  This\r\n  is the only species of iguana in the world that lives in and\r\n  around the water.  The male is quite colorful, and can be 3-4 feet\r\n  from nose to tail.  The females are smaller and colored black.\r\n  Spotting marine iguanas became commonplace during our trip.\r\n  \r\n  Arriving at the hotel, we were greeted warmly, and offered an\r\n  excursion to the Charles Darwin Research Station, located on the\r\n  other side of the town.  We were both tired from the travelling,\r\n  so we decided to pass on the trip, and instead take a short rest\r\n  and explore our hotel.\r\n  \r\n  The Finch Bay Hotel was a fantastic place!  It's in a pretty\r\n  secluded location, and with no car traffic, it's a very quiet\r\n  place.  There's a semi-private beach/lagoon, a pool adjacent to\r\n  the beach, and a bar adjacent to the pool.  The dining area is\r\n  next to the bar, and is essentially an open-air experience, albeit\r\n  with a roof.\r\n  \r\n  After a little rest, we took a water-taxi back to town to meet up\r\n  with Nick and Pardis, who were on a later flight to the islands\r\n  from Quito.\r\n  \r\n  We walked around town a bit, then went back to our hotel for\r\n  dinner.  The meals (included) were delicious and featured local\r\n  seafood, meat, and vegetarian dishes.\r\n  \r\n  <li><b>Tuesday, 12/21 :: North Seymour Island</b> - We woke up early, took the water taxi\r\n  into town, and hopped on the bus to take us back to the dock on\r\n  the north side of the island (where we came from the airport).\r\n  There were about 20 people in this group going to North Seymour\r\n  Island -- a small (1-2 miles in diameter), arid place that serves\r\n  as a nesting ground for Blue Footed Boobies (insert obligatory\r\n  boob joke here), frigatebirds, land and marine iguanas, and\r\n  several other animals.  We all got on a boat, and rode for an hour\r\n  or so before we dropped anchor off the rocky coast of the island.\r\n  Groups of 8 or so people filled the Zodiac the boat was towing in\r\n  order to get to the island.  Getting on the Zodiac was pretty\r\n  straightforward, getting off was tricky!  The driver (captain?)\r\n  would pull the Zodiac right up to the rocks on the cliff.  We had\r\n  to time the step from the zodiac to the rocks just right, as the\r\n  boat was pitching and rolling in the surf.  Everyone made it\r\n  without incident.  \r\n  \r\n  We were immediately greeted by sea lions (males, females, and\r\n  pups), iguanas, and shore birds.  Here is one very important\r\n  fact about the wildlife on the Galapagos -- since there are no\r\n  natural predators of the animals here, they do not have a fear of\r\n  people.  You can walk right up to any of these animals and they\r\n  don't run or fly away.  This is AMAZING and makes for a very\r\n  memorable experience.\r\n  \r\n  Led by our naturalist guide (island expeditions without guides are\r\n  illegal here), we saw some fantastic stuff.  Blue footed boobies\r\n  doing their mating dance, male frigatebirds with their red gullet\r\n  sack inflated to attract mates, baby sea lions nursing and\r\n  playing, male sea lions protecting their territory (interesting\r\n  tangent -- male sea lions here don't go \"bark bark\" like those in\r\n  San Francisco; instead they make the sound of RobBob puking --\r\n  \"bllllleeeeeeeeaaaa  blllllleeeeaaaaa\").\r\n  \r\n  After 90 minutes or so, we had made a circuit of the trail on the\r\n  island, and filed back into the boat for lunch as we motored back\r\n  to Santa Cruz Island.\r\n  \r\n  The second part of the day was spent at a beach on the north end\r\n  of Santa Cruz Island.  Sometimes, there are flamingoes just beyond\r\n  the beach, but there were none when we were there.  This was a\r\n  lovely beach for swimming.  The water was too cloudy for any kind\r\n  of snorkeling though.\r\n  \r\n  After a couple of hours of relaxing, we were back on the boat for\r\n  the short ride back to the dock, and the awiting bus to take us\r\n  back to Puerto Ayora.\r\n  \r\n  That evening, we all enjoyed dinner at our hotel.\r\n  \r\n  <li><b>Wednesday, 12/22 :: Highlands Tour and Glass-Bottomed Boat\r\n  Tour</b> - Again, up early,\r\n  breakfast, and a water-taxi ride into town.  We met up with Nick\r\n  and Pardis and got on a little tour bus to go see some giant\r\n  tortoises (the word \"galapagos\" is Spanish for \"giant tortoises\")\r\n  and other features of the Santa Cruz inland.  There was an\r\n  American family living in Bolivia with us, along with a Brazilian\r\n  family.\r\n  \r\n  Our first stop was at a giant sinkhole -- about 200 yards across,\r\n  and a couple of hundred feet deep.  It was rainging lightly, and\r\n  we hadn't thought to bring our raincoats.  Luckily, after 30\r\n  minutes or so, the rain subsided.  This was a pretty amazing hole\r\n  in the ground.  The echo here was very clear and distinct --\r\n  \"HELLO ............... hello\" was pretty fun.  Lots of neat plants\r\n  and things along the path to the sinkhole.\r\n  \r\n  Back on the bus, we drove for a bit, then dropped up the Americans\r\n  at a horse ranch where they were going to do some riding.  A short\r\n  drive, and we arrived at a place where the Giant Tortoises can\r\n  roam free.  These animals used to dominate the island, but once\r\n  pirates and traders began frequenting the Galapagos in the 1800s,\r\n  their numbers diminished rapidly.  The sailors discovered that\r\n  they could stack the tortoises one on top of another, lying on\r\n  their backs on their ships, and the animals\r\n  would live for a year or more.  Fresh turtle meat was a delicasy\r\n  for these guys.\r\n  \r\n  Anyhow, these animals are huge.  We could get within 5 feet of\r\n  them, and they would not get scared.  Any closer, and they would\r\n  pull their heads into their shell with a mighty exhale.\r\n  \r\n  After an hour or so of hanging out with the tortoises, we headed\r\n  back to the bus.  Our next stop was a lava tube.\r\n  \r\n  Down a bunch of steps, we approached the entrance to this tube.\r\n  Well, it wasn't really the entrance -- it was a place where the\r\n  tube collapsed and was then exposed to the surface.  There are\r\n  many of these tubes underground in these volcanic islands -- this\r\n  was was huge -- about 20 feet in diameter where we entered.  Our\r\n  guide told us that this one extended for miles underground, and\r\n  tapered to a point at the end.  These were channels that lava\r\n  would flow through underground.\r\n  \r\n  Back to the bus, and back to the town.  We stayed in town and hung\r\n  with Pardis and Nick -- got some food and did some exploring.  We\r\n  all then went back to the hotel to hang out by the pool\r\n  \r\n  At 2pm, we went back to the dock by the hotel and met up with Juan\r\n  Carlos, our guide on a glass-bottomed boat tour.  We motored out\r\n  for about 30 minutes to a tiny island just off the coast of Puerto\r\n  Ayora that houses a small research station.  We got to some\r\n  shallow water, and Juan Carlos opened the covers on the glass\r\n  bottom.  It was pretty neat, but the waves were pretty strong\r\n  here, so looking down through the windows on the bottom of the\r\n  boat made most of us queasy, since the boat was rockin' and\r\n  rollin'.  \r\n  \r\n  There were lots of sea lions hanging out on the rocks here.  Juan\r\n  Carlos offered to let us snorkel here.  We weren't really into it,\r\n  the combination of feeling queasy, the waves, and the jagged rocks\r\n  under the water didn't make snorkeling seem like a fun thing.\r\n  Juan Carlos insisted, and told us he'd go with us.  Well, it's a\r\n  good thing we went along with him!\r\n  \r\n  We put on or masks and flippers and got in the water.  It was\r\n  beautiful under there -- not Kauai or Belize beautiful, but lovely\r\n  nonetheless.  We saw parrot fish, sea urchins, and other creatures\r\n  down there -- including sea lions!\r\n  \r\n  This was one of the highlights of the trip -- after 10 minutes or\r\n  so in the water, some of the smaller sea lions on the rocks got up\r\n  the courage to check us out.  It was a bit startling at first to\r\n  have person-sized creatures swimming around us, but it got really\r\n  fun really quick!  I'd dive down under the water and swim around\r\n  one of them, and it would follow suit.  It was amazing to be under\r\n  the water staring eye-to-eye with a sea lion.  Tons of fun.\r\n  \r\n  After half an hour of this, it was time to get back in the boat.\r\n  We motored back to Santa Cruz Island, but not to our normal dock.\r\n  We arrived at a different dock, and prepared for a little hike to\r\n  a place where we could swim.  After 15 minutes or so over the lava\r\n  rocks, past a super salty pond where locals collect sea salt, and\r\n  down some steps, we arrived at a water-filled crevass.  \r\n  \r\n  This is a place where the volcanic activity of long ago split the\r\n  ground in half.  Sea water can flow in and out of this fissure\r\n  with the tides.  Lava rocks extended 40 feet up on either side of\r\n  this calm pool, and the water was about 20 feet deep in places.\r\n  \r\n  It was fun swimming here -- lots of fish and still water.  Juan\r\n  Carlos climed up to the top of the rocks and dove in -- none of us\r\n  had the cajones to follow suit.\r\n  \r\n  After a while of frolicking here, we hiked back out to the\r\n  awaiting boat.  It was a short, calm, sunset ride back \"around\r\n  the horn\" to get back to our hotel's dock.\r\n  \r\n  We again had dinner at our hotel -- Nick wasn't feeling so hot, so\r\n  him and Pardis went back to their hotel in town to rest and get\r\n  some food.\r\n  \r\n  <li><b>Thursday, 12/23 :: Downtime</b> - The original plan was to\r\n  take a 3 hour boat ride from the hotel's dock to Santa Fe island.\r\n  This much boat time didn't appeal to any of us after our queasy\r\n  experienc from the previous day, so we decided to do our own thing\r\n  on Thursday.  \r\n  \r\n  We got up around 9:30 then caught the water-taxi into\r\n  town to meet up with Nick and Pardis.  We had a good breakfast at\r\n  \"Hernan Cafe\".  We managed to raise Nick on our Talkabout radio\r\n  (Nick thoughtfully brought a pair of these radios so we could stay\r\n  in touch).  We brought some laundry to drop off in town ($0.75 per\r\n  pound), then headed off to visit the Charles Darwin Research\r\n  Station at then end of town.  We got there at around 11:30, just\r\n  as most of the places there were closing for lunch -- almost\r\n  everyone takes 2 hours starting at noon for lunch.  We wandered\r\n  around here and looked at some tortoises -- from hatchlings all\r\n  the way up to full grown ones.  There were some yellos land-iguanas\r\n  here too.  We then headed to the water, where there were a series\r\n  of little beaches separated by spits of lava rocks.  There were\r\n  hermit crabs (one trying to pry another out of its shell with its\r\n  claws) and marine iguanas everywhere here.  \r\n  \r\n  After a while, we were getting hungry, so we went back into town\r\n  for lunch -- again at The Hernan Cafe!  Arti and Pardis were\r\n  hungry for pizza, and this was the only place in town that served\r\n  it.  Nick was feeling crummy, so he went back to rest in hotel\r\n  after lunch.  The three of us then embarked on an excursion to\r\n  Tortuga Bay -- allegedly a very nice beach to swim at.  It was a\r\n  45 minute walk from downtown -- through a residential area on the\r\n  outskirts of town, then 2.5Kms along a very nice path through an\r\n  undeveloped area covered with cactii, thorny bushes, and Palo \r\n  Santo trees.  Arti and Pardis hadn't finished their pizza, so\r\n  they took turns carrying it in the box we got from the restaurant.\r\n  \r\n  When we finally arrived at the beach -- it was breathtaking.\r\n  White sand, as fine as corn starch, extended for a mile.\r\n  It was a wide beach, and bordered with iceplant and mangrove\r\n  trees.  The waves were fairly strong here -- and heeding the\r\n  warning of some local folks, we continued to a more secluded\r\n  lagoon to go swimming.  Along the way, we saw many birds, and\r\n  dozens of blue jellyfish that had washed ashore.\r\n  \r\n  The lagoon was a peaceful place -- much smaller than the first\r\n  beach, and zero waves.  There was a woman swimming about 50 yards\r\n  out when we arrived.  I was looking at the water around her, and\r\n  thought I saw a dorsal fin surface nearby.  I kept looking at the\r\n  water, and sure enough the fin appeared several more times.  I\r\n  asked the swimming woman's friend who was also on the beach\r\n  watching if there were dolphins out there.  I think she hadn't\r\n  seen the fin, because she was suprised that I asked this -- and\r\n  gave me the impression that there weren't any dolphins here.  \r\n  \r\n  The fin surfaced several more times, and once very close to the\r\n  swimming woman.  She saw this one -- and quickly made her way back\r\n  to shallow waters.  Later on, we asked some locals around the\r\n  hotel about this, and they laughed -- they said this was likely a\r\n  reef shark, and they were very common in this area!  The sharks\r\n  here haven't attacked people before, so there was really no cause\r\n  for alarm.\r\n  \r\n  Just as we were leaving, Nick's voice came through the radio I had\r\n  in my pocket.  He was feeling better, and had just walked the 45\r\n  minutes to the beach we were at.\r\n  \r\n  We walked back to town together, and went to our hotel.  We spent\r\n  some time swimming in the hotel pool, had some drinks, then\r\n  cleaned up for dinner.  We went to the Angermeyer Restaurant -- a\r\n  very nice place that was a few minutes walk from the hotel.\r\n  \r\n  We had a great dinner, then called it a night.  \r\n  \r\n  <li><b>Friday, 12/24 :: Relaxing Part II</b> - We went into town\r\n  for breakfast at a place called \"Chocolate\".  It was pretty good,\r\n  but not quite as good as what we would have at the hotel.  Our\r\n  plan was to go back to the Charles Darwin Research Station to pick\r\n  up some souveniers, since the souveneir shop was closed when we\r\n  were there on Thursday.  We took a cab up there, since none of us\r\n  really felt like walking -- due to some stomach issues, blisters\r\n  from all the walking on Thursday, and general laziness.  The\r\n  taxi waited for us, and brought us back to the dock.  \r\n  \r\n  We took the water-taxi back to our hotel, and spent the rest of\r\n  the day relaxing at the beach and pool.   In the afternoon, I took\r\n  my camera gear out for a little walk around the area of the hotel.\r\n  The light was really nice, and I managed to get some good\r\n  camera-time in.  I walked almost to the crevass we had swam in,\r\n  but stopped short because I was really thirsty.  The hot equatorial\r\n  sun really takes it out of you.  \r\n  \r\n  I returned to the hotel, and spent some time snacking with\r\n  everyone else.  I told them about my walk, and we decided to all\r\n  go back to the crevass to do some swimming.  We hiked out, spent\r\n  some time in the water, then returned just as it got dark.\r\n  \r\n  We went into town that night for dinner eating again at Hernan --\r\n  it was the only place open.  \r\n  \r\n  It was Christmas Eve, and there were lots of people outside\r\n  downtown.  There was an elephant-truck pulling a train of\r\n  animal-cars filled with screaming elated children tearing through\r\n  town playing loud festive music.  The beer-tap outside the\r\n  supermarket was flowing Pilsener (the local brew) into giant cups,\r\n  and there were a half dozen kids on mini-ATVs buzzing around the\r\n  town basketball court.  The town was alive with energy.  \r\n  \r\n  This was our last evening in the Galapagos -- from here it was\r\n  back to Quito.\r\n  <li><b>Saturday, 12/25 :: Return to Quito</b> - We got up early\r\n  early and checked out of the hotel.  We had a morning flight back\r\n  to Quito.  So after breakfast, we did the now-familiar routine of\r\n  walking to the dock, catching a water-taxi to the town dock, then\r\n  getting in a bus for the hour-long trip across the island.   We\r\n  took the ferry back to Baltra Island, then the bus to the airport.\r\n  We arrived in Quito that afternoon, and met up with Pardis and\r\n  Nick in their <a\r\n  href=http://www.cafecultura.com/html/en/hotel/hotel.htm>hotel</a>\r\n  in downtown Quito.  This was a fantastic place, which used to be\r\n  Quito's French Cultural Center.  We hung out with them, and\r\n  had a lovely dinner in their hotel.\r\n  \r\n  <li><b>Sunday, 12/26 :: Quito Tour</b> - The following day, we\r\n  arranged for a tour of Quito.  We were in the tour van at 9am, and\r\n  saw much of this interesting city with a couple from Costa Rica.\r\n  We stopped at several churches and markets.  We sampled some local\r\n  sweets, and had a traditional corn-based beer.  It was really\r\n  interesting to see all of the French and Italian influenced\r\n  architecture in this city. \r\n  \r\n  After a stop for some water and a coffee (<i>cafe con leche, por\r\n  favor</i>), we drove for a half hour to the northeast part of the\r\n  city to see El Mitad del Mundo.  This is a monument that is\r\n  on the equator, and has a small cultural museum.  The dramatic\r\n  mountains around Quito added a really interesting element to this\r\n  part of the trip.\r\n  \r\n  After the tour, we hung out for a bit, then retired to our hotel\r\n  rooms for the evening.  We had an early day Monday...\r\n  \r\n  <li><b>Monday, 12/27 :: Return Home</b> - We woke up at 4:15 AM so\r\n  that we could pack and catch our 5AM ride to the airport for our\r\n  return flight.  Ouch!  As usual, someone from Metropolitan Touring\r\n  was waiting for us in the hotel lobby to ensure we got to where we\r\n  needed to go.  They really delivered great service.  \r\n  \r\n  Quito to Houston to San Francisco, a pick-up from Tara, and we\r\n  were home.  \r\n  </ul>\r\n  \r\n  Quite a time!\n:title: Ga-Lapa-Went-Us\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  After months of sitting in the living room built, but\r\n  not finished, I finally did the final sanding and\r\n  finishing of this table.\r\n  \r\n  It's a smaller companion to the coffee table I made\r\n  about 4 months ago.  The fun parts took about a day --\r\n  making the design (the funnest part), buying the wood,\r\n  then building the structure.  I learned from the\r\n  coffee table that a table like this needs two kinds of\r\n  braces between each leg -- the \"shelf\", and a\r\n  crossmember that sits just below the table top.  This\r\n  helps to hold the legs square, and makes assembly much\r\n  easier.  With the coffee table, I relied on pegs\r\n  joining the top to the legs to maintain squareness. \r\n  This doesn't work well.\r\n  \r\n  The table is made from maple (legs and edging) and\r\n  3/4\" birch plywood (table top and shelf \"middle\") with\r\n  some Honduran mahogany inlaid between the maple and\r\n  birch on top.  I laminated some 4/4 maple to make the\r\n  legs, and tapered them on the table saw using my Incra\r\n  Miter 1000 as a jig.\r\n  \r\n  The top and shelf are built with birch ply joined via\r\n  biscuits and glue with the mitered maple surround. \r\n  The shelf and crossmembers are joined to the legs with\r\n  glued mortise and tenon joints.\r\n  \r\n  I'm really happy with how this one came out -- I got a\r\n  small belt sander, and was able to get the top very\r\n  flat and smooth.  A belt sander is the right tool for\r\n  this job -- I had used a random orbital sander in the\r\n  past, and would get an uneven surface.  The belt\r\n  sander produces a very flat surface.  \r\n  \r\n  Hours of sanding away glue on previous projects taught\r\n  me to be a little less crazy with using too much glue\r\n  -- so there wasn't much corner-sanding to do on this\r\n  project.\r\n  \r\n  I did the final sanding with some 3M 400 grit \"3x\"\r\n  sandpaper.  This is AWESOME sandpaper.  I never\r\n  thought I would say that, but 3M's sandpaper guys have\r\n  really come up with some innovative stuff.  The \"grit\"\r\n  doesn't  get dull after 2 minutes like most paper,\r\n  also it doesn't start falling off.  The paaper backing\r\n  holds its integretiy for a LONG time.  I used a single\r\n  piece of paper on my sanding block to do this whole\r\n  table, and used it to sand most of the bed frame I'm\r\n  working on now too.  I replaced the paper after I\r\n  nicked it on a sharp corner on the table, and that led\r\n  to the paper tearing a little bit.  But after about an\r\n  hour and a half of continuous use, the grit was still\r\n  biting, and was not \"caked\" with sawdust.  It's really\r\n  great technology and worth the extra money. \r\n  Anyhow....\r\n  \r\n  I took a new direction finishing this piece.  On other\r\n  things I've built, I've gone with several coats of\r\n  stain (waiting a couple hours between coats) then a\r\n  few coats of satin polyurethane (waiting several hours\r\n  and giving a light sanding between coats).  This takes\r\n  FOREVER and the poly never comes out very smooth --\r\n  there are inevitably brush marks or drips in the\r\n  finish.\r\n  \r\n  After seeing some woodwork a neighbor of my parents\r\n  had done, I decided to give Dutch Oil a shot.  This is\r\n  basically linseed oil cut with mineral spirits,\r\n  optionally with a dye or pigment added.  I chose\r\n  Deft's \"Black Walnut\" for this table.  It goes on\r\n  super easy -- just wipe on (i used steel wool), wait\r\n  30 minutes, then wipe off.  Wear Nitrile gloves (the\r\n  blue-green ones) so you don't get that nasty toxic\r\n  stuff on your hands.  \r\n  \r\n  Repeat once, then wait a day for the oil to soak in to\r\n  the wood and dry.  I gave it a good rubdown today,\r\n  then rubbed on a couple of coats of paste wax (I used\r\n  Johnson's -- but then picked up a tin of \"Orange Power\r\n  Premium Carnuba Paste Wax\" that I'll be using in the\r\n  future.  Johnson's smells bad for a couple of days. \r\n  The orange stuff smells pretty nice, and seems to dry\r\n  harder and has a nicer sheen.)  \r\n  \r\n  All in all, very easy -- and the finish is absolutely\r\n  GORGEOUS.  The table surface is buttery smooth, and\r\n  has a very nice consistent satin sheen.  The wood\r\n  grain has an amazing depth -- the wood feels much\r\n  \"closer\" than if it was behind polyurethane.  I'm very\r\n  happy with it.\r\n  \r\n  I'm not sure if it would stand up to the abuse we give\r\n  the coffee table, which for the most part is our\r\n  dinner table, but this is how I'm going to finish\r\n  things from here on out.\r\n  \r\n  So one table down, one bed to go.  The bed frame is\r\n  essentially built and sanded.  I ran some tests today\r\n  so we could decide what the best color for it would\r\n  be.  I'll post a followup article with photos later\r\n  this week when (hopefully) it's finished.\n:title: End Table Finished\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  I put the finishing touches on our\r\n  <a href=/pictures/20050117-bed/>new bed</a>\r\n  today.  It was inspired by the <a\r\n  href=http://www.dwr.com/productdetail.cfm?id=0874>Leggero Bed</a>\r\n  from <a href=http://www.dwr.com/>Design Within Reach</a>.  All in\r\n  all it was a fun project, with very little monotony or frustration\r\n  over the project.\r\n  \r\n  This is a simple platform bed.  The platform\r\n  is made from 1/2\" plywood, and has no heavy bracing to counteract flex\r\n  caused by a load (ahem -- about those 20 lbs I've gained since\r\n  getting married...).  \r\n  \r\n  The secret of this bed is the bowing of the\r\n  \"slats\".  The slats aren't pieces on their own -- they are created\r\n  by cutting slices in the plywood sheets, starting 6\" in from one\r\n  edge, and stopping short 6\" from the other edge.  So the net\r\n  result after cutting is still one piece of wood, just with some\r\n  parallel slices in it.  A small block of wood is attached to the\r\n  middle of alternating slats to create a bow-up/down/up/down\r\n  pattern across the slats.  This makes it nearly impossible for the\r\n  bed to sag along its length (I still think it's magic).\r\n  \r\n  This design is really neat, since there is a minimum amount of\r\n  materials used, and the result is extremely strong.  \r\n  It's a lot like an airplane in this regard, and thus increases the\r\n  cool factor a lot for me.  \r\n  \r\n  The platform is attached to two \"runners\" that run the length of\r\n  the bed.  The runners each have two short legs attached.  I can\r\n  lay in the middle of the bed, and there is no noticable flex in\r\n  the slats or the runners -- this shows the strength of this\r\n  \"bowed\" construction.\r\n  \r\n  I designed the headboard differently than the DWR Leggero bed.\r\n  While their headboard is a smooth piece, I thought the bowed\r\n  construction was too cool to hide under the mattress, so I worked\r\n  it into the headboard design.  The headboard fits into a slot cut\r\n  in one of the platform sheets.\r\n  \r\n  Another driving force in the design was to use the \"end grain\" of\r\n  the plywood as much as possible.  1/2\" Baltic Birch is made of 9\r\n  plies of birch, with no voids.  Lovely stuff.  There are some\r\n  pieces of the bed that are made from 4 layers of this plywood,\r\n  making for 36 glorious plies!  I wanted to show this as much as I\r\n  could.  The supports under the platform and the legs are built so\r\n  that you can see as much of this as possible.\r\n  \r\n  Here are <a href=/pictures/20050117-bed/>pictures</a> of the bed.\r\n  \r\n  (Nerdy wood shop stuff follows....)\r\n  \r\n  Here are the materials I used to make the bed:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>2.5 sheets of 1/2\" baltic birch plywood (beautiful stuff -- 9\r\n  plies and no voids.  This is what skateboard decks are made from)\r\n  <li>20 or so 1/4\" x 2\" machine screws with a countersink head\r\n  <li>20 or so 1/4\" washers\r\n  <li>20 or so 1/4\" nylock nuts\r\n  <li>6 feet or so of 1\" x 1\" maple\r\n  <li>3 cans of Jasco Black Walnut danish oil\r\n  <li>1 tin of Howard's Citrus Shield paste wax\r\n  </ul>\r\n  \r\n  Total materials cost was less than $400, with the plywood being\r\n  the biggest chunk of this at about $320.  Pretty good deal,\r\n  considering DWR wants $1700 for the Leggero bed.\r\n  \r\n  I had the guys at <a href=http://www.southernlumber.com>Southern\r\n  Lumber</a> rough-cut the plywood according to a drawing I brought\r\n  in.  They have the right tools to do this easily -- cutting a 4x8\r\n  sheet of plywood is a clumsy and dangerous job for my tools at\r\n  home.  They have a radial arm saw that can cut across the full 8\r\n  foot length of a piece of plywood.  For $5, how could I argue?\r\n  \r\n  I had them make the following pieces from the plywood sheets:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>(2) 66\"x43\" pieces for the bed platform\r\n  <li>(1) 66\"x27\" piece for the headboard\r\n  <li>(8) 96\"x2\" strips to make the runners under the platform and\r\n  the feet\r\n  </ul>\r\n  \r\n  The first thing I did when I got home was to glue up two stacks of\r\n  the 2\" strips for the runners.  There were four strips in each stack.\r\n  The stacks really looked cool -- 2\" square profile with 36 layers\r\n  of wood.  I spread an even coat of glue between each piece, and\r\n  clamped 'em up overnight.  The next day, I ran each edge of the\r\n  laminated stacks through the table saw to clean up the edges, then\r\n  cut them to length on the sliding compound miter saw.\r\n  \r\n  The next step was to build the headboard and platform pieces.  I\r\n  contemplated how to do this -- I would have to accurately position\r\n  the piece over the fully lowered saw blade, turn on the saw, then\r\n  raise the blade up through the plywood.  I'd then have to push the\r\n  piece, making the cut.  I'd have to stop the cut short of the end\r\n  of the piece accurately, lower the blade back into the saw body,\r\n  then turn off the saw.  \r\n  \r\n  To help make the cuts accurate, I built a\r\n  long (7 foot) extension for the saw fence, with pieces attached to\r\n  the ends of the extension to stop the plywood in the right places.\r\n  So the process was: position the fence, push the plywood against the\r\n  fence and against one end-stop, turn on the saw, raise the blade\r\n  up through the wood, push the wood to the other stop, lower the\r\n  blade, and turn the saw off.\r\n  \r\n  Once I made the jig, it was pretty straightforward to cut all the\r\n  slots.  I alternated between 2\" and 3\" slot widths on the platform\r\n  part.  The 2\" pieces get \"pushed down\" by the spacer blocks.\r\n  Since they're slimmer (weaker), they'll be pushed down more than\r\n  the wider pieces are pushed up, making the surface the mattress\r\n  sits on flatter.\r\n  \r\n  After this, it was a matter of positioning the platform pieces on\r\n  the runners (laminated pieces) and drilling holes and\r\n  countersinking for the screws, washers, and nuts.\r\n  \r\n  After a bunch of sanding (see the <a\r\n  href=http://nobot.2y.net/stories/?i=109>table article</a> to review my love\r\n  of 3M's \"3X\" 400 grit sandpaper), I applied the Danish Oil with a\r\n  paint roller, which made fast work of what could have been a\r\n  tedious job -- well, getting the oil in the 3/16\" wide slat-slices\r\n  was kinda tedious.  \r\n  \r\n  Two coats of the oil, with liberal rubbing-in and rubbing-off of\r\n  the excess, and it was ready for the wax after a day of drying.  \r\n  \r\n  As I found with the table I finished last week, Danish Oil + Paste\r\n  wax is a great combo for a really nice finish.  Both go on easily,\r\n  and both are extremely hard to screw up.  Compared with\r\n  polyurethane (goes on tough, super easy to mess up) it's a winner.\r\n  I think the only case where I'd look to polyurethane would be on a\r\n  table that saw lots of use and liquids (e.g. dining room table).\r\n  \r\n  After two coats of wax and several hours of drying time, we moved\r\n  the new bed into the bedroom.  It looks really nice with the wood\r\n  floor and the other stuff in there.  With the mattress, sheets and\r\n  blankets on it looks like a real bed!\r\n  \r\n  So all in all, a fun project -- a unique design, very little\r\n  materials, and a cool bed that will hopefully last us a long time.\r\n\n:title: 36 Glorious Plies\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  When I was in college, my dad worked for a company that had a\r\n  relationship with a mattress-maker.  He was able to get products\r\n  from them at a good discount, so when I \"officially\" grew out of\r\n  my childhood twin-sized bed, he got me a Queen mattress.  It was\r\n  awesome!\r\n  \r\n  Fast-forward 10 years...  Married for a couple of years, and still\r\n  sleeping on that same mattress.  My back started to hurt a few\r\n  mornings per week; and with the sheets off, there was a noticable\r\n  dip in the middle of the mattress.\r\n  \r\n  Time to to mattress shopping!\r\n  \r\n  Both Arti and I immediately had three ideas: \"Dux Bed\", \"pillow\r\n  top\", and \"memory foam\".  So off to the web to do some shopping...\r\n  \r\n  The nearest Dux store was a 45 minute drive from here, and their\r\n  beds were several thousand dollars.  Too much effort at this\r\n  point.  A good pillow-top mattress was at least a thousand\r\n  dollars, most are fifteen hundred.  A \"Tempur-Pedic\" memory foam\r\n  mattress ran anywhere from two to three thousand dollars.  I found\r\n  some knock-off memory foam mattresses, but those were a thousand\r\n  to fifteen hundred dollars.\r\n  \r\n  Then I found it -- an online store claiming to make a mattress\r\n  identical to the Tempur-Pedic \"Celebrity\" bed (their\r\n  top-of-the-line model), with a detailed diagram of the different\r\n  layers of foam, right down to the density and type of each one.\r\n  \r\n  Oh yes ... This got me thinking -- maybe I could just make my own!\r\n  I had been to \"Bob's Foam Factory\" in Fremont in high school to\r\n  get some padding for a watertight camera box (really a 50 caliber\r\n  U.S. Army ammo box), so I figured there's gotta be some place to\r\n  get the right kinds of foam.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=http://bobsfoam.com/>Bob's Foam Factory</a> didn't carry\r\n  memory foam, so I couldn't give them some more business.  However, \r\n  some searching did come up with a few places that did carry it.\r\n  \r\n  I settled on <a href=http://www.foamdistributing.com/>Foam\r\n  Factory Inc. / Foam Distributing / economyfoam.com</a> (ya, all\r\n  three names are on the site in some place or another).  They had\r\n  it all, and the prices were pretty good.  They were running a free\r\n  shipping offer too, so there ya go.\r\n  \r\n  Here's what I ordered (from the top surface of the mattress to the\r\n  bottom layer):\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>$95 <a href=http://www.foamdistributing.com/products/memoryfoam4.html>MF4Q62</a>\r\n      Memory Foam 4.3LB - Queen - 60\"x80\"x 2\"</li>\r\n  <li>$182 <a href=http://www.foamdistributing.com/products/memoryfoam5.html>MF5Q63</a>\r\n      Memory Foam 5.3LB - Queen - 60\"x80\"x 3\"</li>\r\n  <li>$34 <a href=http://www.foamdistributing.com/products/eggcratecon.html>LRFE82</a>\r\n      Lux Regular Foam - Eggcrate - 82\"x76\"x 2-1/2\"</li>\r\n  <li>$114 <a href=http://www.foamdistributing.com/products/lux-hq.html>LHQFFS84</a>\r\n      Lux High Qual. Foam - Full Sheet - 82\"x76\"x 4\"</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  Total price, shipped, was less than $450.\r\n  \r\n  To ship the foam, they wrap it in plastic in some sort of vacuum\r\n  chamber.  The big 4\" thick bottom piece came in a box only about 1.5\r\n  feet on a side.  I opened the box, then rolled out this\r\n  plastic-wrapped ball of highly compressed foam.  I poked it a bit\r\n  with an X-Acto knife, and this hissing and groaning sound filled\r\n  the house.  It started to grow.  After a minute or so, there was\r\n  this big ol' rectangular piece of foam in the middle of the living\r\n  room.\r\n  \r\n  The memory foam takes a lot longer to decompress -- a couple hours\r\n  at least.  Just make sure you have a place to set it (on the floor\r\n  where the bed will be, hmm?) so that it can expand unfettered.\r\n  \r\n  Since only the memory foam pieces were cut to a Queen size, I\r\n  had to cut the others.  I had a bunch of ideas, from carving at it with\r\n  an X-Acto knife to getting my Skil Saw out and making a mess of\r\n  it.  I eventually compromised and used a serrated bread knife and\r\n  a long board as a straightedge.  It worked fine.\r\n  \r\n  So with all the layers cut to the right size, it was just a matter\r\n  of stacking them up on the bed platform.  The foam is pretty\r\n  grippy, so it doesn't need to be glued or attached to one another.\r\n  \r\n  The cool thing about making your own mattress is that you can\r\n  really customize the density of the foam according to what you\r\n  like.  I picked a medium density top layer for the \"cozy factor\", and\r\n  a higher density second layer for support.  The eggcrate provides\r\n  a breathing channel to help maintain a good temperature.  The\r\n  bottom layer is just to prevent the mattress from \"bottoming out\"\r\n  in case you decide to do pushups on it or something (your fists\r\n  would fully compress the memory foam and touch the bed frame\r\n  without the thick, firm layer underneath).\r\n  \r\n  The first night was awesome -- the memory foam material is just\r\n  super comfortable -- it holds you nicely, and it maintains a\r\n  pleasant temperature.  I woke up the next morning with a happy\r\n  back -- and it's stayed back pain free for the 9 months since we put\r\n  the mattress together.\r\n  \r\n  I'd like to make a slip cover for the whole thing, but a normal\r\n  mattress pad has been working just fine.  Maybe one day...\r\n  \r\n  So all in all, a good move.  The foam should last at least as long\r\n  as a normal mattress (10+ years, 25 years for a couple of the\r\n  layers).  \r\n  \r\n  ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz.............\r\n  \r\n  UPDATE May 12, 2008 -- the top layer of memory foam (the lightweight one) has given up the ghost and lost its mind.  The other layers of foam are still in great shape, so we're rolling without the thin one.  Comfortable once again!\r\n\n:title: Make Your Own Mattress\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  If my years at the <a href=http://www.yahoo.com>Big Y!</a> have taught me\r\n  anything, it's that UNIX -- speficially FreeBSD -- rocks.  It's incredibly reliable (there are busy production servers at work answering more than 50 requests/second that haven't been rebooted for three years), and extremely efficient.  \r\n  \r\n  Shortly after starting my job, I installed FreeBSD on a machine at home, and have been reliably serving this web site from it ever since.\r\n  \r\n  Imagine my curiousity when Apple revealed a few years ago that its new operating\r\n  system, \"OS X\", would be built using FreeBSD as a basis.  Very interesting -- Apple, known\r\n  for building high quality equipment with an emphasis on user interface was going to\r\n  release a UNIX based operating system.  This could be cool.\r\n  \r\n  Time passed.  The OS was released.  Folks that I work with and regard very highly \r\n  started to show up to work with Macs.  They are uber-nerds, and they were using Macs.\r\n  I thought Macs were for kids in school.  \"No Way!\", they said, \"there is a very powerful\r\n  kernel lurking under this awesome looking interface\".  \r\n  \r\n  But alas, Macs were expensive.  The price of entry was a couple thousand dollars for\r\n  a machine that would work for me.  More time passed.\r\n  \r\n  Earlier this month at the MacWorld show in San Francisco, Steve Jobs unveiled two \r\n  products that would blow the bottom out of Apple's pricing structure.  The iPod \"Shuffle\" \r\n  -- a $100 MP3 player the size of a pack of gum, and the Mac Mini -- a 72 cubic inch hot rod\r\n  starting at $500.  (The computers in my house occupy an average of\r\n  2,000 cubic inches each.) \r\n  \r\n  There was my chance -- $2000 was always too much money to \"try\" this technology.  But $500, \r\n  now that's a different story altogether!  The Mac Mini has no keyboard,\r\n  mouse, or monitor.  You have to supply those parts.  But that's fine --\r\n  the target consumer already has one or more PC's, so they already have these\r\n  components.  I guess I fit their target customer profile pretty well.\r\n  \r\n  I went to Apple's online store site several times after the product was announced and\r\n  configured a new system.  That's the great thing about online shopping -- you can roam\r\n  around a store, dropping items in your shopping cart, but then walk out empty-handed leaving\r\n  the cart at the door, and nobody gives you funny looks.  Fantasy-shopping.\r\n  \r\n  Last week, I read an article that indicated that Apple's retail locations would\r\n  begin selling Mac Minis on Saturday January 22 at 9AM, opening an hour earlier\r\n    than normal.  This really got me thinking -- I could replace the computer in\r\n  the living room that was running Windows XP and the computer in my office that\r\n  runs FreeBSD with this one tiny machine.  No more big, clunky, noisy machines.\r\n  Just a slick little silver box.\r\n  \r\n  It only took a little bit of spousal marketing to get Arti excited about the Mini too. \r\n  She has always been awesome at supporting my hobbies -- camera equipment, new\r\n  power tools, stuff for the car, etc -- but this seemed a little extravagant.  After all, the computers we had were working flawlessly.  But she\r\n  actually got excited about the tiny little computer.\r\n  \r\n  I told her about how they were going to go on sale Saturday early AM, and I\r\n  wanted to be one of the first people to get one.  My plan was to get to the\r\n  Valley Fair store an hour before the store opened.  She was down with the plan\r\n  -- she even wanted to wait in line with me.  Alright!  Budgetary committe approval!\r\n  \r\n  We arrived at the Apple Store at 8AM.  There were already 20 or so people\r\n  waiting in front of the store.  That was good news for us -- most of the people\r\n  wanted to get the $100 iPod Shuffle, so I was confident there would be enough\r\n  Minis to go around.\r\n  \r\n  When the stoore opened at 9AM there were about 300 people waiting.  The woman who was\r\n  first in line entered, then soon exited with a long face -- she wanted to get a Shuffle, but \r\n  there were none to be had!  This caused a bit of an uproar in the crowd.  You would think\r\n  that the Apple Store employees would have made an announcement to the crowd prior to \r\n  the store opening.  Suprisingly bad customer experience there.\r\n  \r\n  As we approached the door, we were greeted at the door by a friendly employee who asked us if we were getting a\r\n  Mini.  I smiled and said \"oh yes.. the one with the faster CPU and bigger hard\r\n  drive.\"  \"I'll be right back with it\" he said.\r\n  \r\n  A couple minutes later, we were on our way back home with the lunchbox-sized\r\n  package.  It took only a minute to  set it up in the living room, hooking it up to\r\n  the <a href=http://www.sharpusa.com/products/ModelLanding/0,1058,1394,00.html>TV</a>.\r\n  I turned it on, and was pleasantly suprised that everything worked -- even my Microsoft wireless \r\n  keyboard and mouse.  \r\n  \r\n  The setup process was fantastic, and over the next two days, I set up all my\r\n  photo and music apps (Live 4, Albino, Reason, CaptureOne, etc -- they are all cross-platform applications), as well as\r\n  setting up apache, PHP, and MySQL.  \r\n  \r\n  I got an external firewire hard drive enclosure and pulled one of the drives\r\n  from the FreeBSD machine so that I could run daily backups of the Mini's\r\n  internal disk.  I also picked up a 512MB PC2700 DDR DIMM from <a\r\n  href=http://www.centralcomputer.com/>Central Computer</a> to bump up the Mini's\r\n  internal RAM from its stock 256MB.  Derek and I had fun getting the case opened\r\n  to upgrade the memory.  Closing the case took some figuring, but we managed to\r\n  do the upgrade without breaking or scratching anything.  The performace of the\r\n  system improved quite a bit with the additional RAM installed -- well worth the low price of\r\n  the memory.\r\n  \r\n  So far, so good.  The OS X interface is fantastic.  It does take some getting used to the\r\n  different keyboard shortcuts (the \"windows\" key on my keyboard gets the most use now).   \r\n  \r\n  All the applications I use are set up, and it's now the official Nobot\r\n  Chatterbox web server.  It's awesome that so much performance and usability can\r\n  come from such a small box.  Consider me switched!\r\n  \r\n  If anyone from the Mac Mini product team is reading this -- nice work!!!  This is the start of something huge for Apple.\r\n\n:title: Mac Daddy\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  It all started when I saw <a\r\n  href='http://www.rtpnet.org/robroy/lawrence/landscape.html'>these\r\n  photos</a> that George R. Lawrence took of San Francisco right\r\n  after the 1906 earthquake.  He had been working on using kites as\r\n  aerial photography platforms, and had nearly perfected his\r\n  technique when the quake hit.\r\n  \r\n  I had run across some other sites online where people had used\r\n  kites and weather balloons as photographic platforms, and it\r\n  really seemed like fun.\r\n  \r\n  The last straw came yesterday when I saw that my friend and\r\n  ex-coworker Mikel had been doing <a\r\n  href='http://flickr.com/photos/mikel_maron/1278842/'>some\r\n  experiments</a> with a power kite to lift a camera.  His photos\r\n  were great, and I had a whole day to play....\r\n  \r\n  So off to do some research online.  There are <a\r\n  href='http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=kite+aerial+photography&ei=UTF-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&fr=moz2'>suprisingly\r\n  many</a> resources online for information on this hobby.  I read\r\n  up on different types of kites (soft, structured) and how the size\r\n  and design of the kite affects how much it can lift.\r\n  \r\n  Another important component of using a kite to hoist a camera is\r\n  how the camera is suspended from a kite.  Some folks like to use a\r\n  pendulum-type of arrangement to hold the camera level, but I liked\r\n  the <a\r\n  href='http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/equip/picavet.html'>Picavet\r\n  Suspension</a> design.  It is simple and lightweight, and not only\r\n  holds the camera level, but very steady as well.  It doesn't\r\n  attach to the kite itself, but to the line -- at least 50 feet\r\n  down the string from the kite for maximum stability.\r\n  \r\n  So after some doodling, it was off to find a kite and to get the\r\n  parts to make the Picavet.  I went to <a\r\n  href='http://www.djhobby.com'>D&J Hobby</a> to find the kite.  I\r\n  left with a <a\r\n  href='http://www.newtechkites.com/ntk_product_profile.php?PSKU=55352'>New\r\n  Tech Patriot Sky Hook</a>.  It's a BIG kite -- 30 square feet of\r\n  lifting area.  Since it is a \"soft\" kite (no structural rods), it\r\n  packs up into a very small space.  You could fit four or five in a\r\n  normal backpack.\r\n  \r\n  After a stop at Home Depot to get some eye bolts, carabiners,\r\n  aluminum plate, and other hardware, it was back home to the\r\n  workshop.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"/pictures/20050212-kitecam?0\"><img class=\"thumb\"\r\n  align=right valign=top\r\n  src=\"http://nobot.oceanairflightservices.com/20050212-kitecam/thumbs/CRW_7105-platform.jpg\"\r\n  /></a>\r\n  The Picavet was easy to make -- I made the cross from some 1/2\"\r\n  birch plywood I had on hand, using a half-lap join in the center\r\n  of the cross.  I used 2\" wide aluminum strip stock to make the\r\n  camera cradle.  It all went together pretty quickly.\r\n  \r\n  The secret to the Picavet is how the string is threaded between\r\n  the carabiners and the eye bolts on the platform.  The suspension\r\n  string is a single loop of line.  I used a <a\r\n  href='http://www.une.edu.au/~unemc/dbfish.htm'>Double Fisherm*n's\r\n  Knot</a> to join the two ends of the string.  Knots are cool.\r\n  \r\n  After I got everything together, I checked the <a\r\n  href='http://weather.noaa.gov/weather/current/KNUQ.html'>weather\r\n  at Moffett Field</a>, a Navy/Air National Guard/NASA base next to\r\n  Shoreline Park.  The wind was blowing at 8 knots -- perfect!.  So\r\n  I drove out to the <a\r\n  href='http://www.gwtw-kites.com/Shorelineparkmt.viewca.info.asp'>Kite Flying\r\n  Area at Shoreline Park</a>.  There were several people there.\r\n  Some flying dual-line stunt kites, a guy doing some kite surfing,\r\n  and parents with little kids and little kites.  I sat in the car\r\n  for a while to get a sense for how the wind was blowing and where\r\n  I could set up.\r\n  \r\n  After 15 minutes or so, I picked up the stuff and walked out to a\r\n  remote corner of the kite flying area.  I hadn't flown a kite for\r\n  a long time, and definitely never one this big, so I was a little\r\n  nervous.  I figured I should fly the kite for a while before\r\n  hooking up the camera to make sure I wouldn't be putting the G3 in\r\n  danger.\r\n  \r\n  I unrolled the kite and tied my line onto its bridle.   Holding\r\n  the bridle in one hand, I spread the kite out into the wind with\r\n  the other.  Immediately it took to the sky.  Easy!  I didn't have\r\n  a proper kite-flying spool, just a ball of nylon string I got at\r\n  Home Depot (intended for masonry work, I think).  \r\n  \r\n  The kite was a real handfull!  It really pulled hard.  It was very\r\n  steady in the sky too.  This was encouraging -- I had a good\r\n  feeling I'd get the camera up there.\r\n  \r\n  Letting more and more string out was pretty easy, I just had to\r\n  relax my grip on the spool a tiny bit and it whizzed right out.\r\n  After 10 minutes and a couple hundred feet of line, I figured it\r\n  was time to reel it back in.  Oh boy, I didn't plan for that.\r\n  Without handles on the spool of string, this was a tough job.\r\n  Needless to say, my thumbs were super tired after the 20 minutes\r\n  of continuous winding it took to pull the kite back in.\r\n  \r\n  I tied a couple of <a\r\n  href='http://www.une.edu.au/~unemc/alpbutt.htm'>Alpine Loop</a>\r\n  knots in the string 10 feet apart about 50 feet below the kite.\r\n  These would serve as mounting points for the Picavet.  \r\n  \r\n  It was pretty tough after launching the kite to hold onto it with\r\n  one hand and clip on the Picavet with the other.  I managed after\r\n  some struggling and a couple \"choked\" fingers.\r\n  \r\n  Still holding on to the kite-line spool with one hand, I turned on\r\n  the camera with the other.  One <strong>excellent</strong> feature\r\n  of the Canon G3 camera is its \"intervalometer\" feature.  You\r\n  basically tell the camera \"take a picture every X minutes\".  This\r\n  is perfect for kite photography, since without it you would need\r\n  some kind of remote-control for the shutter release.\r\n  \r\n  So with the intervalometer armed, I started letting out the line.\r\n  It worked really well.  The wind had died down a bit, and my hands\r\n  were tired, so i didn't let the kite get out over 80 feet or so\r\n  (meaning 30 feet of height for the camera).  It did a good job\r\n  though -- very steady.  \r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"/pictures/20050212-kitecam?1\"><img class=\"thumb\"\r\n  align=right valign=top\r\n  src=\"http://nobot.oceanairflightservices.com/20050212-kitecam/thumbs/CRW_7087-kite-and-cam.jpg\"\r\n  /></a>\r\n  I tied the line to a nearby fence and used my other camera to take\r\n  some photos of the rig in the air.  Not once was I worried about\r\n  damage to the G3 -- even when the wind would die down, it would\r\n  float very gently lower.  The camera did hit the grass on the\r\n  ground a couple of times, but it was a super-soft landing.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"/pictures/20050212-kitecam?6\"><img class=\"thumb\"\r\n  align=left valign=top\r\n  src=\"http://nobot.oceanairflightservices.com/20050212-kitecam/thumbs/CRW_6573-self_portrait.jpg\"\r\n  /></a>\r\n  I figured out that I could bring the kite down easily by putting\r\n  the line under my arm (near the fence where it was tied up) and\r\n  walking out toward the kite.  It was all slowly pulled to the\r\n  ground.  I did this a few times to lower the rig so I could re-aim\r\n  the camera.  After it was aimed, it was just a matter of lifting\r\n  my arm to release the line, and it was back to the skies!\r\n  \r\n  All in all, I'm pleasd with the result of yesterday's experiments.\r\n  I would have been happy just to see how the kite flew, but it was\r\n  so good that I was comfortable putting the camera up there.  I'm\r\n  really looking forward to more days and places with this rig!\r\n  (Kauai, anyone?)\r\n\n:title: Kite Aerial Photography, Experiment I\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  During last weekend's BMW CCA Car Control Clinic, I realized that the BMW tuned\r\n  the E46 M3 for understeer.  I think their intention was safety -- with so much power\r\n  available, it's all to easy for a beligerent, leadfooted driver to spin the car\r\n  exiting a corner.  By making the front tires lose traction first, I think BMW was trying to avoid\r\n  the M3 having a reputation as a car that is hard to control.\r\n  \r\n  Plowing around the different exercises at the Car Control Clinic wasn't as fun\r\n  this time as last year in my old E36 M3 with H&R Coilovers and 17x9 BBS RGR\r\n  wheels all around.  The E36 was dialed in -- beautiful neutral handling; the\r\n  E46 was not.  Around the skidpad, I had the E36 dancing around the cones with\r\n  the throttle connected magically to the turning radius.  The E46 just plowed\r\n  around no matter what I would do.\r\n  \r\n  Driving home from the CCC, I decided this must change.  The car's soul is just to good\r\n  to cripple it with so much understeer.\r\n  \r\n  After doing lots of research online, I learned that three important things need to be changed\r\n  about the E46 M3 to make it handle better.  First, the front end needs more negative camber.\r\n  The stock suspension allows for maybe one degree of negative camber, not enough\r\n  to keep the outside front tire planted on the ground in hard cornering.  Instead, it rolls\r\n  onto the outer edge of the tire and loses traction (hence, understeer).  Second, the\r\n  front bumpstops are too long.  When the outside front suspension is loaded up going around a\r\n  corner, the soft springs allow the shock to compress the bump stop too easily.  The result\r\n  of this is the \"effective\" spring rate (or \"wheel rate\") goes to infinity.  A\r\n  high front wheel rate relative to the rear means the front loses traction (hence, understeer).  Third,\r\n  the springs and shocks are not matched very well.  The springs are very soft,\r\n  and the shocks don't seem to be well matched to them.  The car rolls a lot, and thus exaserbates\r\n  the first two problems (hence, understeer).\r\n  \r\n  I knew I needed camber plates to address the lack of negative camber, different\r\n  bump stops, and different springs and shocks.  I looked at many different options, and\r\n  decided that <a href=\"http://www.ground-control.com/\">Ground Control</a> was the way to go.\r\n  \r\n  The Ground Control Street/Track kit (the \"1849 Kit\" in their nomenclature)\r\n  addresses all of these problems deftly.  It has their race camber plates, with calibrations etched\r\n  onto the plate face.  They work with the stock strut tower brace, so that's an extra bonus.\r\n  When you order a suspension kit from GC, they basically interview you to determine what spring\r\n  rate will bring the most satisfaction.  My priorities were: decrease understeer, preserve\r\n  most of the good ride of the stock M3, reduce some body roll (within reason).  Jay at GC recommended\r\n  440 lb/in fronts and 550 lb/in rears.  \"You can take this to the track, but not get bitched at\r\n  when you go places with your wife\" was how he explained the kit.  Fantastic!  So I placed the order on Monday.\r\n  \r\n  The kit arrived Friday.  Arti called me at work at 2pm when she got home, \"There's a big box\r\n  outside the front door.  It's too heavy for my to bring in, so I'll leave it out there for you.\"\r\n  Nothing at work can be as important as a new suspension, so home I came!\r\n  \r\n  The components were absolutely beautiful.  GC's custom threaded spring perch\r\n  collars were anodized red, with anodized gold perches.  The camber plates are\r\n  anodized black.  The yellow Koni shocks (top adjustable all around is standard\r\n  with the 1849 kit) are nice pieces too.  It was almost a shame to put the kit\r\n  on the car where it would get all kinds of grit, grease, and grime on the components.\r\n  But better handling awaits!  The front struts (strut, bump stop, camber plate)\r\n  and rear shocks (shock, GC rear shock mount [RSM]) were completely assembled.\r\n  They have a shock dyno, so the Koni shocks are precisely adjusted to your chosen\r\n  spring rate.  Excellent!!!\r\n  \r\n  I got started about about 5pm.  The rear was straightforward.  Move the\r\n  carpeting in the sides of the trunk out of the way to get at the RSM nuts\r\n  before you get greasy.  Put the rear of the car on jackstands, remove the\r\n  wheels, remove the shocks, pull out the springs.  Don't forget to release the\r\n  e-brake, otherwise you won't be able to get the springs out.  The new rear springs\r\n  have adjustable spring perches to adjust ride-height.  These must be attached\r\n  to the upper control arms.  Easy.  I put the collar right in the middle of the\r\n  adjuster, and the ride height ended up just right -- 13\" from center of wheel\r\n  to fender lip.  Put in the new springs, bolt in the shocks, check the torque of\r\n  the 3 bolts per side.  Put the wheels on, put car on ground, torque log nuts.\r\n  Total time for the rears: 1.5 hours.\r\n  \r\n  Time for dinner.  Total time: 30 mins.  Total tastiness: off the charts.\r\n  \r\n  Now for the front.  Drive the car up on Rhino Ramps to get access to the front\r\n  jack puck in the center of the front of the car.  Jack up car, put on jack\r\n  stands.  Remove wheels.  Remove the four nuts that hold the factory strut tower\r\n  brace onto the strut towers.  Remove brace.\r\n  \r\n  E46 M3's with xenon headlights have a sensor that's connected to the front\r\n  lower A-arm to keep the headlights level when the car goes over bumps.  This\r\n  sensor must be relocated with the GC kit.  It comes with instructions and some\r\n  hardware to do this.  Pretty easy, but it was difficult to drill the one hole\r\n  that was necessary to mount the sensor.  Having a short-profile right angle\r\n  drill would make working in the confined space a lot easier.\r\n  \r\n  The E46 M3's front struts are different than the E36 in that the bottom of the\r\n  strut on the E46 slides into a \"pinch collar\" on the steering knuckle.  The E36 just\r\n  bolts on to the steering knuckle.  The Bentley manual specifies that the lower\r\n  A-arm must be removed in order to get the strut out, but Jay gave me a little\r\n  hint to getting the strut out without having to take more things apart.  It took more than his hint.\r\n  Here's what to do:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>When working on the passenger side, turn the steering wheel all the way to the left. (this was Jay's hint)\r\n  <li>Remove the two 19mm bolts holding the brake caliper on, remove the caliper, and put it\r\n      somewhere so that the brake hose is not strained.\r\n  <li>Remove the bolt holding the swaybar connector to the strut\r\n  <li>Loosen the three nuts on the strut tower as much as possible without taking them off, or remove them then put them back on one full thread\r\n  <li>Remove the 19mm bolt that \"pinches\" the steering knuckle around the strut\r\n  <li>Jimmy the strut around so that the steering knuckle drops down as much as possible.  It will seem impossible to get the strut the rest of the way out (but it's not!)\r\n  <li>Now go back up top and tighten the three strut tower nuts (this is the secret step!)\r\n  <li>You can then go back down to the steering knuckle and jimmy the strut the rest of the way out.  It <b>will</b> come out!\r\n  <li>Remove the three strut tower nuts, and you can remove the strut.\r\n  </ul>\r\n  Installation, as they say, is the reverse of removal.  Getting the old strut\r\n  out is the hardest part.  The new struts are shorter than the originals, so\r\n  they go in very easily.  Button up the struts, torque the pinch bolt to 81\r\n  ft-lbs, and tighten the strut tower nuts.  I set the camber plates to an\r\n  indicated -2.0 degrees.  It's a good place to start -- I'll let a pro align and\r\n  corner-balance the car \"for real\".\r\n  \r\n  I originally set the height-adjusters to\r\n  halfway between highest and lowest, but the car sat a bit high, so I lowered it three full turns from that midway point.  That pretty much nailed the\r\n  recommended 13.5\" from center of wheel to fender.\r\n  Put the wheels on, put the car back on the ramps, torque the lug nuts, and back\r\n  off the ramps.  Reinstall the factory strut tower brace, and take it for a ride.  Total time for fronts: about 2.5 hours\r\n  \r\n  My first impression?  \"YEEE HAW!!!\"  This is WAAAY better than I expected.  The ride is both a bit firmer\r\n  than stock, and at the same time more comfortable.  Body roll is cut in half, and the car seems\r\n  VERY eager to enter and carve through turns.  It still has that wonderful \"planted on the pavement\" feeling\r\n  at 80-100mph that the car came with from the factory.\r\n  \r\n  Arti and I went for a drive both last night  (pre-suspension) and tonight (post-suspension).  She feels the car is more comfortable now, and I feel it handles 100% better.  Win, win!  I love it!\r\n  \r\n  As I said, the ride height is just about 13.5\" front, 13.0\" rear.  I did a poor-man's camber measurement and came up with -2.25 degrees rear, -3.0 degrees\r\n  front.  I'm not sure how accurate my method is, but it doesn't matter so much.\r\n  I have an appointment at <a href=\"http://www.tcdesignfab.com/\">TC Design</a> in\r\n  Milpitas to get the car aligned and corner-balanced.\r\n  It looks good, drives good, and handles good.  I'm a very happy customer.  Big\r\n  ups to the guys at GC for engineering such a awesome product!\n:title: Wowsers!

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  Shortly after we returned from our Christmas/New Years <a\r\n  href=\"/pictures/20041225-galapagos/\">trip to the Galapagos</a>, Arti knew she\r\n  was pregnant.  A home pregnancy test and a trip to the doctor confirmed this.\r\n  This was great news, since we had decided to take the next step and \"pulled the\r\n  goalie\" a few months back.  That was cool -- a baby conceived in the Land of\r\n  Darwin, a group of islands on the equator and full of unique animals.\r\n  \r\n  After a few weeks, we had an appointment with our midwife for our first ultrasound.  \r\n  Looking at that tiny, rasberry sized creature on the screen was unreal.  We could\r\n  watch the tiny heart valves opening and closing so quickly.  The \r\n  magnitude of the situation hadn't really set in though.  Our baby was just a little \r\n  tadpole on a TV screen.\r\n  \r\n  In February, we took another trip -- this time we went to <a\r\n  href=\"/pictures/20050214-kauai/\">Kauai</a> with Derek &amp; Emily, as well as\r\n  Todd, Becca, Nate, and Chloe.  This was a fantastic trip, and very relaxing.\r\n  It was lots of fun to be in such a beautiful place with good friends and\r\n  family.  Arti was feeling a little bit of morning sickness at this point, but\r\n  for the most part we could cavort without taking special \"pregnant\"\r\n  precautions.\r\n  \r\n  One very quiet night in our cozy house I had a dream about our new baby.  It\r\n  was a quick dream -- very succinct.  An old figure approached me on the bed\r\n  from the other side of the room.  [S]he said plainly <i>\"you are going to have a\r\n  daughter and you should name her Marina\"</i>.  This figure had visited me in dreams\r\n  before, and has given good advice, so I took this very seriously.\r\n  \r\n  I woke up immediately and woke up Arti.  I told her about this dream.  She thought\r\n  it was interesting, but not as prophetic as I had seen it.  I wasn't suprised, since\r\n  I'd have a hard time putting a lot of faith in someone else's dream guide. ;-)\r\n  \r\n  After Kauai, we had a few more appointments with the midwife.  At the 20 week\r\n  appointment, we were scheduled for another ultrasound.  We would likely be able\r\n  to see the gender of our baby at this appointment.  I was a little less excited\r\n  than Arti, since I already knew we were having a girl ;-).\r\n  \r\n  We got a couple of baby name books, and got many good suggestions from family\r\n  and friends.  Our cousin Vishal was particularly interested in the name we\r\n  would choose, and had several well thought out ideas he presented to us.  No\r\n  other name sat with me like Marina though.  It just fit so well -- not only the\r\n  sound of it, but its connection with the ocean (and the Galapagos), as well as\r\n  the breadth of cultures that embrace the name.  I've heard of Spanish, Italian,\r\n  Greek, and Russian women with this name.  That was good for us, I thought,\r\n  since I wanted her to have a name that reflected her international lineage.\r\n  \r\n  Time passed, and Arti's belly grew and grew.  We grew to admire our midwives\r\n  (there are two that work at the office we would go to) and appreciate that we\r\n  were able to go through this experience with them.  The work they do is so \r\n  important, since giving birth is not necessarily a medical procedure.\r\n  \r\n  The name \"Marina\" sunk in slowly into the mind of Arti and others in our families.\r\n  We didn't want to commit to a name before we saw her face, so we didn't really talk\r\n  about it like it was going to be her name (but, again, I knew it should be ;-).\r\n  \r\n  Fast forward to September.  Our due date, as predicted by the ultrasound\r\n  computer was September 12.  Early September brought only a little bit of\r\n  apprehension to our house.  Our midwives were so relaxed and reassuring that\r\n  things were going just fine, so our anxiety was really minimal.  My mom arrived\r\n  from Washington to stay with us to help with the delivery and post-delivery\r\n  fun.  \r\n  \r\n  We talked a few times about middle names.  I suggested that we select a name of an\r\n  important member of her family.  Since she was stuck with \"Steinkamp\" at the end of \r\n  her name, an Indian name would be a good balance.  After reviewing some candidates,\r\n  I really liked her maternal grandmother's name \"Kailash\".  It sounded nice,\r\n  and I thought that it was a respectful gesture to Arti's grandmother.  My\r\n  friend AJ turned me on to the name's <a\r\n  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kailash\">significance</a>.  \r\n  \r\n  The due date came and went with Arti feeling only mild, occasional\r\n  Braxton-Hicks contractions.   It was 9 days later that things really got\r\n  rolling.\r\n  \r\n  Arti knew something was brewing in her belly the morning of September 21.  The contractions\r\n  seemed to be coming from lower in her belly, and were a tiny bit sharper than the\r\n  ones she had felt in the previous days.  They still weren't sharp enough to stop\r\n  her in her tracks, so we went about our day.  The three of us went to lunch, and \r\n  decided a walk would help jump-start things.  While walking on the <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=701+first+ave,+sunnyvale,+ca&ll=37.420404,-122.023226&spn=0.004582,0.011579&t=k&hl=en\">paths behind Yahoo!</a>\r\n  the contractions got strong enough so that Arti had to pause to let it pass.  We knew the time was near!\r\n  \r\n  At 5pm or so, things were really heating up.  In the middle of a contraction,\r\n  Arti said, \"I think we better get to the hospital\".  We called her mom, then\r\n  Lin the midwife at about 6pm.  We arranged to meet Lin at the hospital at 7pm.\r\n  I wolfed down dinner, then we got in the car.  Our moms followed shortly after.\r\n  \r\n  We got there, and sure enough Arti was dialated 4cm.  \"So we don't have to go\r\n  home and wait?\", I asked Lin.  \"Nope, we're going to have a baby tonight!\",\r\n  Lin said in her lovely British voice.\r\n  \r\n  Over the course of the next 6 hours, Arti's contractions got stronger and stronger.  There\r\n  was a shower in the room's bathroom, which we made use of to help Arti through the tough\r\n  contractions.  I brought my swim trunks (the nurses don't want to see husbands\r\n  without clothes! ;-) so I could be in there with her to rub her back and give\r\n  her support.  The shower was a godsend -- I can't imagine dealing with the strong\r\n  contractions without it.\r\n  \r\n  The midwives were great, not only at guiding me and the moms through comforting\r\n  Arti, but also in making sure her and I had some good \"alone time\" (sans-moms)\r\n  in this special occasion.  That was really nice -- the moms were great and\r\n  helpful, don't get me wrong, but it was nice to just have some time with my\r\n  wife.\r\n  \r\n  Once it became time to push, we all sharpened our focus.  No other time in my life \r\n  have I been so present in the moment, so focused on the here-and-now.  It was absolutely incredible.\r\n  All of us were rooting Arti on.  Really rooting -- shouting and hooting.  It was just fantastic.\r\n  \r\n  After about 30 minutes of pushing, Lin waved me over to look at the baby's\r\n  head.  Her hair was just visible inside of Arti.  This was encouraging to Arti\r\n  when I described what I saw, and just floored me. \r\n  \r\n  Another 15 minutes or so, and her head began to crown.  Arti could now reach\r\n  down and feel the baby's hair.  This gave her even more reason to give another\r\n  150% of effort to push that baby out.  \r\n  \r\n  I got to watch her head emerge, and saw her face as it was out in the air for\r\n  the first time.  She was a purply color and turned to the side.  She was just\r\n  beautiful.  So this was the little rascal that had been kicking and punching\r\n  Arti's ribs and bladder for the past 9 months?  Well, we can forgive her.\r\n  \r\n  The rest of her came out pretty quickly.  A great exhale of releif and\r\n  exhaustion echoed through the room.  Lin handed the baby to me to place on\r\n  Arti's stomach.  She was so wet and slippery, but I knew I wouldn't drop her.\r\n  It was really a moment I will never forget.  I had thought I would be a bawling\r\n  wreck at this point, but I think the adrenaline and the exhaustion were\r\n  stronger that that.  I was just happy to have a healthy baby girl.\r\n  \r\n  I got to cut the umbilical cord, and Lin helped Arti deliver the placenta\r\n  shortly after.  We put Marina on the scale -- 9 lbs 2 ozs.  A big, healthy\r\n  girl!\r\n  \r\n  The hospital was super busy that night, so there were no private maternity\r\n  rooms left.  This means that I had to go home!  Bummer!  After taking Marina to\r\n  get her first bath, I took Marina to the nursery and left the hospital at 5am.\r\n  This was really difficult, but both Arti and I needed the sleep.\r\n  \r\n  I was barely able to sleep, and woke up at 8am or so.  I got in the shower, and\r\n  just lost it.  I was just bawling like a little kid.  The magnitude of the\r\n  situation really hit me like a ton of bricks.   I didn't know if I was happy,\r\n  or scared, or what.  I just needed a good, long cry.  I got dressed and went to the kitchen\r\n  to make some breakfast.  My mom and Arti's mom had come back to the house at\r\n  about 3am, and they were both still here.  I saw my mom and just lost it again.\r\n  I gave her a big, sobbing hug.  It was a really special moment.\r\n  \r\n  I gathered myself together and had some coffee, and went back to the hospital.\r\n  Arti looked great, considering what she had just been through.  She was happy\r\n  and excited to come home.  Hospital protocol dictated that she stay one more\r\n  day, but she was never one to adhere to protocol.  We called Lin and asked her\r\n  if we could leave early.  \"Oh yes.  Of course you can my darling.  Let me make\r\n  some calls.\"  She called us back a short time later, and explained that the\r\n  pediatrician cleared us to go home that afternoon, with the stipulation that we\r\n  take Marina to the pediatrician's office the next day.  No problemo... Home we\r\n  went!  \r\n  \r\n  The next hours were a blur.  Lots of staring at Marina, with amazement at\r\n  everything she would do. I know we went to sleep that night, and slept only a\r\n  little bit.  The trip to the pediatrician the next day was easy.\r\n  \r\n  I had the next two weeks off from work, which was great.  I would have rather\r\n  taken three or four or fifteen weeks off, but it's tough to be gone for that\r\n  long.\r\n  \r\n  It seems that it's been months since she was born, rather than weeks.  Every\r\n  day she changes a bit -- whether it's her eyes getting more color, or her\r\n  reactions to things, or how she recognized me or Arti.\r\n  \r\n  I'm sure I'll have lots more stories to tell.  I wanted to get this one down\r\n  though so that one day Marina can read it.\n:title: The Story of Marina\n:excerpt: A recap of the events leading up to, and including the birth of our beautiful Marina.\n"

Mimi Ess, a member of the growing population of soccer-mom-cum-political-activisits shows us what it means to be a truly compassionate person.  She sees right through the current federal administration's veil of religion and morality and gazes deep into their dark hearts.\"\n:title: Letter to Pres Bush\n:content: |-\n  <em>If I suddenly disappear, you'll know why.  Here's the\n  letter I just sent to the Prez.</em>\n  \n  Dear President Bush,\n  \n  In the last week I read that you announced that we do\n  not torture prisoners and I read that Dick Cheney has\n  called for broad permission to treat prisoners in any\n  way needed to get them to give us information.  I also\n  have heard that you have threatened to veto the bill\n  that contains John McCain's amendment binding us to\n  the rules of the Geneva Conventions.  All this shocks\n  me and makes me wonder what is going on in your\n  administration!  We must not treat prisoners\n  inhumanely, even if they are terrorists!  We are not\n  terrorists and must not act like them!\n  \n  It is fine to say that Americans don't torture\n  prisoners but we all saw the pictures.  When my\n  husband served in the Army during the Viet Nam war, he\n  was taught that any thing his unit did was his\n  personal responsibility.  We have watched low level\n  enlisted people be tried for their behavior at Abu\n  Gheraib prison, and we have heard that one general was\n  relieved of her post as a result.  This is a weak\n  response in my opinion.  Your own Attorney General\n  made statements indicating that your administration\n  did not necessarily feel bound by the Geneva\n  Conventions.  Setting a tone like this cannot help\n  individual soldiers make good decisions.  All of you\n  in Washington are partly responsible for the terrible\n  actions in Iraq, please take proper responsibility.\n  \n  Last week I also heard that the CIA has set up secret\n  prisons in countries that allow torture.  When this\n  news came out, there was a loud cry from the\n  Republicans in Congress to find and punish those\n  responsible for leaking this sensitive information.\n  This makes my stomach turn!  When someone exposes an\n  agency of our government acting reprehensibly, we\n  should act to end the reprehensible behavior and\n  punish those who initiated the behavior not those who\n  brought it to light.\n  \n  Several years ago, I visited a museum in Arizona that\n  had an exhibit of letters home from German POW's.\n  Again and again, in those letters, the German\n  prisoners marveled to their families how well they\n  were  being treated.  Some even expressed the wish\n  that their families could enjoy the same care.  What a\n  different message this sends to people who are at war\n  with us.  When we live out Jesus' command to love our\n  enemies, we make it possible for the enmity between\n  people to end.\n  \n  You have a long way to go to earn my trust.  When your\n  words do not match the actions of your administration,\n  and when your own Vice President is often heard saying\n  exactly the opposite of what you have said, I cannot\n  trust what I hear from you.  I fear what will happen\n  if we continue on your present course.\n  \n  I continue to pray for you.\n  \n  Sincerely,\n  \n  \n  Mimi Ess\n"

The first snow of the season!  \n  \n  Becca and I walked to a craft show this evening and when we came out to walk  home, the snow had started.  No evidence of sticking yet. We may wake up to snow on the ground or not.  Still, it is snowing.    \n  \n  How is it that each summer we forget that snow means slippery sidewalks, slushy roads and muddy footprints in the house? Tonight, all I remember is the fun of waking up to a snowy world. That odd white light first thing in the morning and the extreme quiet  of new snow stays fresh in my memory.  I suppose the complete  transformation of the familiar neighborhood into a\n  smooth and sparkling  white world carries enough wonder to chase all practicality out of mind.\n  \n  A couple of times during our years on Mt. Roberta, we awoke to a dusting of snow.  Usually it was gone by the time we finished breakfast.  Still, we waited for those mornings each winter.   Two\n  snowy mornings stand out in my memory.  The first was simply  cold at our house but when I got to the pool and was swimming backstroke, it was snowing on me.  The second was a truly snowy\n  morning.  I got up at 5 a.m. to make my normal trek to the  pool.  That day, I came face to face with the less magical side of  a snowy day.  Driving down the hill, I ducked under downed wires,\n  drove around trees hanging over the road, worried about slipping and  sliding into the creek, and turned around to go home only when I came  to a really big tree across the road.  Maybe we'll\n  have days like  that here in our cozy neighborhood in town, but I doubt it.\n  \n  I imagine that in this part of the world it will only snow a few times  during each winter.  Maybe we'll get a couple of inches, maybe it  will last a few days.  No drifts, no blizzards.  So, I say,  \"Let it snow!\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  It's been a while since I've written anything here.  I've mostly been consumed with day-to-day stuff: Marina, Arti, work, projects.  I thought it would be good to write down what Marina has been up to in the past month or so.\r\n  \r\n  As the <a href='/video/'>video</a> shows, Marina is now really really good at rolling herself onto her belly.  She did it for the first time maybe three weeks ago, but only did it once.  Then days passed, and she did it twice.  There was a 1+ week lull of any rolling activity, then she seemed to just get it.  Now when she wants to be on her stomach, she is!\r\n  \r\n  This made me realize that kids (and adults?) develop all  skills in much the same way.  First, there is the element of \"beginner's luck\", where the skill is stumbled upon.  In the case of rolling over, I think Marina was kicking her legs around, and everything just fell into place.  When the luck fades, then frustration sets in.  The person thinks \"well, I thought I could do this!\".  At this point, it's all Practice Makes Perfect.  Repitition and practice is key to building the muscle memory around the skill.  After that comes mastery.\r\n  \r\n  Marina is just grabbing at everything right now.  She used to struggle with her arms to grab and hold on to something waved in front of her.  Now she just can't get enough holding and examining.    The exersaucer that James and Teresa gave us has really helped hone her eye-arm-hand coordination, since she can spend long amounts of time playing with things around her.\r\n  \r\n  When she's fussy at dinnertime, I'll sometimes put her on my lap while I eat.  Last week, she started grabbing at my food!  She has also started watching Arti and I very intently while we are eating -- I think something is clicking in her mind about what we are doing.  I'm not sure if she knows that we're eating, but she's interested nonetheless.\r\n  \r\n  Arti has been doing a great job with her \"EC\" (Elimination Communication -- a fancy word for \"Potty Training\").  Lots of people think we're nuts for putting a 4 month old on the toilet, but we've been rewarded with almost zero poopy diapers for nearly a month now.  Hopefully once she is more skillful at communicating, she will no longer need diapers.  This is a common thing outside of the US -- notably in China and India, babies older than 1 year usually are done with diapers.  We hope we can get there too!\r\n  \r\n  So that's about it for baby tricks.  Check out <a href='/pictures/'>pictures</a> and <a href='/video/'>video</a> of our little one!\n:title: New Tricks\n:excerpt: A short summary of Marina's development in the past month or so.  Potty training, rolling over, grabbing things, and interest in food are her new tricks.\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  <img align='right' src='/images/marina_diaper_free.jpg' alt='Marina on her potty.' style='border:1px solid black'>Zack and I decided early on that when Marina could\r\n  walk and communicate, she should also be potty\r\n  trained. We couldn't see ourselves changing the diaper\r\n  of a two year old after being instructed by her to do\r\n  so. Hence, our potty journey began. \r\n  \r\n  I had talked with my mom about how she potty trained\r\n  my brother and I. She told me she would hold us over\r\n  the toilet when she thought we had to go and by the\r\n  time we were about a year old, we would take ourselves\r\n  to the bathroom. Simple as that. \r\n  \r\n  When Marina was a few\r\n  weeks old, Mimi sent me a New York Times Article about\r\n  infant potty training. I think she sent it as a joke!\r\n  The article suggested that the reader check out the\r\n  website <a href='http://www.diaperfreebaby.org'>www.diaperfreebaby.org</a> for more information.\r\n  After exploring the website I found a local group that\r\n  I joined. I lurked on the list for many weeks, not\r\n  quite sure how, when, or if we would ever start. \r\n  \r\n  I decided that we needed a potty chair. Everyone on\r\n  the list seemed to prefer the Baby Bjorn Little Potty\r\n  (aka BBLP) so that's what I got. That sat around\r\n  unused for several weeks. I also decided to purchase a\r\n  potty turtleneck that some people on the list talked\r\n  about. A potty turtleneck is a nifty little accessory (like a toilet seat cozy) that takes the chill out of the BBLP. The turtleneck\r\n  was made by some nice ladies at <a href='http://theecstore.com/'>The EC Store</a>. \"EC\"\r\n  stands for elimination communication - another name\r\n  for infant potty training. \r\n  \r\n  I spent many weeks thinking about how in the world we\r\n  were going to get Marina to pee or poo on her potty.\r\n  It seemed impossible. I asked my mom again how she did\r\n  it and what I should do to start. She told me to put\r\n  Marina on the potty every time I changed her diaper\r\n  and just see what happens. She also said that I\r\n  wouldn't make a catch every time but it was a good\r\n  start. My immediate reply was, \"If I'm changing her\r\n  diaper, she obviously doesn't have to go to the\r\n  bathroom because she just went!\" My mom told me to\r\n  just do it. So I left it at that. \r\n  \r\n  A few more weeks went by. I read this book called\r\n  Diaper Free by <a href='http://www.natural-wisdom.com/'>Ingrid Bauer</a>. It was interesting but it\r\n  still didn't make sense to me. I wanted to have it all\r\n  figured out before i tried it. \r\n  \r\n  The next thing I did was to move the BBLP into\r\n  Marina's room. I thought maybe if it was near the area\r\n  where we change her, i might put her on it. It sat in\r\n  her room for a couple of weeks. \r\n  \r\n  Finally, on the night of December 30, I had a\r\n  revelation. I was going to do it! The time had come. I\r\n  was changing Marina's diaper. Before I put on the new\r\n  one, I set her on the BBLP and made the cueing sound,\r\n  \"Psss, psss, psss.\" Viola! She immediately pooped! I\r\n  was thrilled! I felt so proud of her and myself!\r\n  \r\n  Little did we know, but our life was about to\r\n  become even more focused on poo and pee. We continued\r\n  on, putting Marina on her potty after naps and\r\n  whenever we thought she might have to go. At first we\r\n  didn't catch much, so I began keeping track of the\r\n  intervals at which Marina peed and pooped. I also\r\n  looked for signals she would give when she had to go, such as certain fussy noises.\r\n  \r\n  After many misses, I came up with a pretty good\r\n  system. Now, on most days we catch 75-80% of the pees\r\n  and 100% of the poops. \r\n  \r\n  Zack and I are very happy that we are potty training\r\n  Marina. We wouldn't have it any other way. It seems so much more hygenic to take a baby to the bathroom when it's time to pee or poo. \r\n  \r\n  Babies don't just fuss or cry for no reason - they're trying to tell you something!\n:title: Potty Time, Excellent\n:excerpt: Toilet train an infant?

After attaching\r\n  two 250GB Firewire hard drives (mirrored using the RAID software built-in to\r\n      Mac OS X), it stored all of our music, photos, videos, and coding projects.\r\n  It was the house's music server, web server, mail server, and file server.  I\r\n  would use Photoshop to work on images, Live and Reason to compose music.  It\r\n  did it all, and now they are telling me that the new one is four times\r\n  faster?!?!

After slogging through\r\n  the now-hammered <a href='http://store.apple.com/'>store.apple.com</a> site,\r\n  where it took their heavily burdoned servers more than a minute to verify my\r\n  credit card, I had a new Mini configured and in their system.\r\n  \r\n  I selected the $22 \"overnight shipping\" option because I'm impatient, but later\r\n  got it refunded because the system was built in China and FedEx'd to my house.  There\r\n  is no overnight FedEx from China ;-).\r\n  \r\n  The machine is wicked fast.  It just smokes the G4 PPC Mini in anything, except for\r\n  when it runs apps compiled for PowerPC using the Rosetta translation utility, then things are\r\n  slightly slower than the old Mini.  Not a big problem, since most things I use are compiled\r\n  now for both Intel and PowerPC.  A notable exception is Photoshop, but I can work around that\r\n  for now.\r\n  \r\n  <h1>April 2006</h1>\r\n  \"duomini\" has been a pleasure to use each day.

It's a half-hour drive from there to Willows.  <a href='http://johnr.com/'>JohnR</a> and I caravaned up from the Bay Area for the event.\r\n  \r\n  It was my first outing with <a href='http://ncracing.com/'>NCRC</a>, and Pops' first time on a road course.  We shared my car, running in two different run groups.  NCRC does a great job of running a track event.  It's more casual than the BMWCCA events I've been to, but it works.\r\n  \r\n  <img align='right' src='http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060505-thill/images/MF1A0247.jpg' width='300'>My first couple of sessions were done solo -- sans instructor.  That's all fine and good, but this was a different configuration of the track than I've driven on.  Rather than the steep uphill, 90 degree left-hander, and sharp downhill \"Cyclone\" Turn 5, we ran \"The Bypass\", which is a blind over-crest, off-camber right hand sweeper.  My first time though it I felt like I was going to fly off the track.  Solo sessions are fun, but there is very little learning that can happen at my level (skill- and confidence-).\r\n  \r\n  Pops had a great instructor from the start.  Jay Hudson is a long-time instructor, and a recent Club Racer.  His patience and skills in the art of high performance driving instruction really made a great day for my dad.  Pops came away from the day with a feeling of acomplishment, and a fine regard for the proper line on a race track.  I'm very excited for his next trip to Thunderhill, since I think he'll be more comfortable dialing in some speed to his experience.\r\n  \r\n  I was lucky enough to catch a session with Jim Bassett in the passenger seat.  Jim wasn't signed up as an instructor, but I know that he's one of the most talented guys out there.  To get any time with him in a car -- either riding along or driving -- is a valuable thing.  He showed me a brilliant line through The Bypass that allowed me to proceed with confidence through the rest of the day.\r\n  \r\n  My \"official\" instructor was Margaret Cheng, who currently races a Spec Miata, and is known to most of the guys she races against as a force to be reckoned with.  She showed me that she is an incredible instructor too -- her confidence and encouragement really helped me to find more speed and stability on the track.  I've never been so high up on the berms before, and at the same time, never carried as much speed through some of the turns -- especially Turn 9.\r\n  \r\n  So really a great day at the track.   The car felt awesome all day.  It was my first time running a \"square\" wheel/tire setup -- I've got a set of four OE 18x9\" wheels with 255/40-18 OE Continental tires.  They're noisy and squealy, but a great tire to learn on.  It was also the first day running dedicated track brake pads -- Performance Friction PF01s.  They were AWESOME throughout the day.  They seemed to bite harder the hotter they got.  I experienced zero fade all day, and this was running double-duty with my dad driving the car too.  I made sure to bleed the brakes the night before, and top off the Motul RBF-600 brake fluid.  I'm sure that helped a bit.\r\n  \r\n  I've signed up for the BMWCCA school at Thunderhill in August, and am registered to do an event with Hank Watts' Coastal Driving School at Sears, err Infineon in June.  I'm really looking forward to continuing this addiction, and hope to get Arti out to the track one of these days -- as soon as we can leave Marina with her Nana and Nani overnight...\r\n  \r\n  <a href='http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060505-thill/'>Photos are here.</a>\r\n  \r\n  <a href='http://www.thenobot.org/video/'>Videos are here.</a>\n:title: Thunderhill NCRC Recap\n:excerpt: This could very well have been the ideal day at the track.

  data: "--- \n:content: \"I've been doing HPDE events at local race tracks for the past 10 months in my 05 ZCP, and have been pretty happy with how the car felt at higher speeds.  Prior to this past week, I've had the following modifications to the car:\\r\\n\\\n  <ul>\\r\\n\\\n  <li>GC Coilovers (Single Adjustable Konis, 440f / 550r)\\r\\n\\\n  <li>GC Camber plates\\r\\n\\\n  <li>Front end: Camber: -2.6 deg, zero toe\\r\\n\\\n  <li>Rear end: Camber: -2.0 deg (the minimum for the ride height), 1/16 toe in\\r\\n\\\n  <li>Motul RBF-600 brake fluid\\r\\n\\\n  <li>Stoptech SS braided teflon lines\\r\\n\\\n  <li>PF-01 pads on the front (Axxis Ultimate for Auto-X)\\r\\n\\\n  </ul>\\r\\n\\\n  Autocrossing on this setup left a bit to be desired.  The safety-biased handling that works well for my intermediate level skills at higher speeds  just turns piggish at autocross speeds.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  At last month's autocross, my first practice run was my best time for the day.  That's pathetic.  It showed me that I was trying to drive WAY to fast, and just overdriving the understeering balance of the car.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  I recently managed to put together a set of four 18x9 OEM wheels, and did one track day with those, running a 10mm spacer on the rear.  Better handling in the slow sections (e.g. turn 11 at Thunderhill), still very controllable and safe feeling.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Yesterday was the first autocross event I did with the \\\"square\\\" wheel and tire setup.  I decided not to run the spacer in the rear for autocross, since the rear end isn't hurting for grip.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Prior to the event I maxxed out the negative camber in the front of the car to approximately -3.25 degrees (very approximately).  Driving the hour down to the Marina airport was a handful -- additional negative camber also adds toe-out to the front tires.  That combined with the big tires up front made the car want to follow any dip, crack, or micrometer-measurable imperfection in the road.  Luckily, I made it without incident.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  In autocross conditions, the car is now (finally!) in its element.  Gone is the necessity to have absurdly low corner entrance speeds to compensate for the low-speed understeer.  The car is neutral feeling throughout the corner, and the tail is very (too?) easily coaxed out with a little gas or a strong lift.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <div style='float:right; text-align:center;'>\\r\\n\\\n  <a href='/video/watch.php?20060520-autox.mov'>\\r\\n\\\n  <img src='/video/video.thenobot.org/20060520-autox.mov.jpg' width='120'><br>\\r\\n\\\n  Watch one run.</a></div>\\r\\n\\\n  Yesterday, I started out taking it pretty easy, and made a conscious effort to build from there, going as far as to not use full throttle anywhere until the third run.  But based on how the car felt, it was VERY difficult to hold back.  It just felt too good, entering and exiting turns with an eagerness I hadn't felt from it before.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  I had two much more experienced drivers ride along with me, and they were both taken aback by this E46 M3's ability to get around the corners.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  So it was a great day out there.  I have a new found enthusiasm for doing autocross in this car.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Prior to coming home, I set the front camber back to my street/track setting, and had a nice relaxing drive back north, with a big smile on my face...\\r\\n \"\n:title: Finally!

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  Back now from a great day at Infineon with the <a href='http://coastaldriving.org/'>PCA Coastal Driving School</a>.  They're an outfit associated with the Porsche Club of America's Monterey Bay and Loma Prieta regions.\r\n  \r\n  Sunday morning I prepped the car for track duty -- bleed the brakes, put the track brake pads on the front, put on the track wheels/tires (OEM BMW 18x9 wheels with 255/40-18 Continental street tires).  I also dialed in some additional negative camber in the rear to try to solve a slight tire rubbing problem (it didn't solve the problem).  Got the car packed up before bedtime, and hit the sack at 10pm or so.\r\n  \r\n  Nights before track days are always, unfortunately, restless for me.  I can't help doing mental laps around the track or course I'll be driving the next day.  I woke up at 4AM and just lied in bed until it was time to get up at 4:45.  Made coffee and a little breakfast, then headed up to SF to meet up with Derek.  \r\n  \r\n  Got to his place at 5:45, and we caravaned through the city, and went across the Golden Gate Bridge as the sun was rising.  What a sight!  It was awesome -- I wished I could stop and take some pictures of the  approach to the bridge, but there was a track waiting.\r\n  \r\n  We arrived at Infineon at 6:45 AM and found Arturo and JohnR there already.  Got the cars teched, and it was time to start the day.  We set up the excellent shade structure that Arti's parents had given us the day before.   This was a lifesaver, since the Infineon sun can be pretty draining.  A couple of fold-out chairs and a cooler full of cold drinks helped keep us relaxed and hydrated.\r\n  \r\n  Overall the day was awesome.  I had a pretty rough start in the morning sessions -- Sears (Infineon's \"old skool\" name) is a mental challenge.  I started the day with an <a href='http://coastaldriving.org/images/candy/chp1.jpg'>instructor </a>in the car, which helped me get through the process of getting back to where I was the last time out there.  Unfortunately Derek was left without an instructor in the morning.  I couldn't imagine trying to learn Sears solo -- it's such a complicated track.  Hank did go out with Derek for a session in the afternoon, which I was happy to see.\r\n  \r\n  I ran the later sessions solo, which ended up working out fine.  However, the next time I'm out there, I will push for a day of full instruction.  \r\n  \r\n  I had a couple of scary moments at Turn 10 in the midday sessions.  For those unfamiliar with Sears, 10 is the last turn in a sequence (\"the esses\"), where each turn is faster than the last.  I will take Turn 10 somewhere around 95MPH.  It's very unforgiving though -- if you don't turn in at the right moment, you are bound to run out of track at the exit, and there is a big wall just off the edge of the track.  Very unforgiving.  There were a couple of times where I know I was saved by the car's traction control system.  I turned in to 10 too early, and had to lift the throttle to get the car to tighten its turning radius.  I felt the back end get light (like it was about to spin), then felt the Magic Hand of Traction Control set the back end back down.  I took it pretty easy through 10 until the last session, when I felt more comfortable with the track and the car.\r\n  \r\n  The most memorable part of the day was in the early afternoon when I got to take a few laps riding shotgun in Hank's <a href='http://coastaldriving.org/images/slideshow/1.jpg'>Monster 911</a>.  This car is 2200lbs and makes 650HP on a bad day.  The capabilities of the car coupled with Hank's driving was a breathtaking combination.  And I mean that literally -- when the turbo spooled up with full throttle in 2nd gear, I could not breathe.  He was charging into and out of corners WELL over my level of familiarity with the laws of physics.  The car accelerates, brakes, and corners with a tenacity that I have never experienced.  It was a religion-inspiring ride.  I kept thinking of Marina and Arti in the car, and reminding myself that Hank is one of the best drivers and instructors in the country.  I was oscillating between \"Marina needs a dad.\" and \"Hank is an excellent driver.\" over and over during the course of our four lap excursion.  I can't put into words the G-forces that he was able to generate in that machine.  Stunning.  Absolutly stunning.  As in I had to take a break after riding in the car because I was stunned like a person would be stunned after getting sucker-punched by Tyson.\r\n  \r\n  <div style='float:right'><a href='http://www.thenobot.org/video/watch.php?20060605-infineon_5th_session.mov'><img src='http://www.thenobot.org/video/video.thenobot.org/20060605-infineon_5th_session.mov.jpg'><br>(Watch Video)</a></div>After gathering myself after Mr. Watts' Wild Ride, the last two sessions of the day went really well.  I felt like I got to know the track a bit better, and was finally comfortable pushing the car a bit around all the corners.  Nothing like the 30-degree slip angles that Hank so deftly managed, but definitely more speed than I had been able to carry around the track.\r\n  \r\n  There were three \"incidents\" that day, which was unusually high in my experience so far.  I'm not sure if all the cars had to be trailered home, but I'm sure one did.  Nobody was injured, but it's never fun to see damaged cars towed off the track.\r\n  \r\n  Like other track days, the last session came too soon, but was welcome at the same time.  Two hours of driving on the racetrack is just about right for me -- any more than that and I start to feel fatigued.  So at 5pm we packed up the stuff and had an uneventful drive home.\r\n  \r\n  This morning I washed the car, removed all the black rubber marks from all over the front and sides with Klasse, swapped the street wheels/tires/brakes back on and reset the rear camber.  I tried to do it before Marina woke up, but she beat my by 20 minutes.  Oh well, one day she can help!\n:title: Infineon Coastal Driving Recap\n:excerpt: Another great day at the track.

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  Porsches have ruined me for other cars.  Every time I'm able to drive one, I realize just a little bit more of the magic of what makes people coo-coo for them.\r\n  \r\n  It all started with the '05 Boxster S (987) that I test drove before getting the M3.  Sweet Mother of Handling Grace!  The car is amazing in all kinds of turns, from tight 90-degree city street elbows to sweeping freeway connectors.  The balance of the car is just amazing.\r\n  \r\n  Then Derek got his 997 Cabriolet.  I recall the first time I really got to drive it for any length of time, and I spent the whole drive swerving back and forth at 55mph on San Tomas Expressway.  The feeling of the steering on that car was like a drug -- there was something uniquely rewarding about how it felt shifting weight side-to-side.\r\n  \r\n  A few months later, <a href='http://jkb.org/'>Jan</a> got a base-model Boxster as a loaner while his 996 was having some work done.  He let me take it out for a 30 minute flogging session on the \"Test Circuit\" around work.  Even though this is Porsche's cheapest car, its capabilities are astounding.  No, it's not going to win any stoplight drag races, but it has a way about it that is unique to any car I've ever driven.  Balance and communication, balance and communication.\r\n  \r\n  Jan's 996 is a 2003 Cabriolet with 14K miles on it.   I drove it a bit before and after he bought it.  That car didn't feel nearly as good as the others -- the front end just felt floaty and disconnected from the road.  He wanted to make it handle a bit better, so he ordered the \"ROW MO030\" suspension from the dealer.  This is the \"Rest of World\" sport suspension -- apparently US cars are more softly sprung and ride almost an inch higher than Porsches everywhere else.  Driving his car after the suspension was <a href='http://tcdesignfab.com/'>installed</a> was like night and day.  The car felt very agile and planted, and lo and behold, there is that magnificent Porsche communication with the driver through the steering wheel.  More joyful swerving down San Tomas.....\r\n  \r\n  I had to have some of this.  I've been methodically upgrading the suspension on the M3 since I got it.  First were shocks, springs, and camber plates to get some handling balance potential into the car.  Next came equal-sized wheels and tires for track days.  This made the car extremely fun and well balanced on the track.  After that, I got a Ground Control front swaybar to help the front end stick to the road a bit better to help the car rotate through turns (yes, this goes against common advice, but a lowered M3 does not posess a common suspension setup).\r\n  \r\n  The car is nicely balanced and very fun to drive on track or autocross, but driving those Porsches leaves me wanting more!\r\n  \r\n  My search for more communication from the suspension lead me to the soft rubber bushings that connect the suspension arms to the chassis of the car.  Under hard cornering, the rubber deforms, changing the toe angles of the front and rear tires in proportion to load.  The net result is a car that feels vague and mushy and does not respond well to small changes in steering angle at the limit.  Could addressing this lead me closer to Porsche-like nirvana?\r\n  \r\n  Ground Control makes some <a href='http://www.ground-control-store.com/products/description.php/II=162/CA=103'>gorgeous \"Hybrid\" (aluminum / urethane) bushings for the front control arms</a>.  The consensus is that they do a lot in terms of controlling the motion of the suspension arm to its intended axis of motion, while preserving the quiet and smooth ride of the stock pieces.  Powerflex makes a pure <a href='http://www.evosport.com/product/default.aspx?catid=552'>urethane bushing for the rear lower control arm</a>, which a very common fix/upgrade for cars whose rubber bushings have torn.\r\n  \r\n  A swift call to <a href='http://dermotorsports.com/'>Dan Law</a> and the pieces were en route from Atlanta.  After a nearly unbearable weeklong wait for UPS to deliver the goods, I brought the car to <a href='http://tcdesignfab.com/'>TC Design</a> for installation.  It's possible to do the install myself, but with the proper tools it's an easy two hour job, versus 8 hours of cutting, hacking, chiseling and swearing.  I left this one to the pros.\r\n  \r\n  Initial impressions from the drive home: The car feels a tiny bit stiffer -- sharp bumps come through to the cabin a little bit more than with the stock bushings.  It feels much more agile though; almost as if I went to a stiffer spring.  (This is indeed the case, since the entire suspension system from tires to bushings to springs and shocks contributes to the \"wheel rate\" or the amount of force required to move the wheel some unit of distance.)\r\n  \r\n  I did some brief \"testing\" on the four varied cloverleaves that connect San Tomas Expressway to Central Expressway.  There is a nice mix of second and third gear right-hand corners.  This is where I felt the most difference.  The mushiness at the limit has been replaced with a very precise and controllable feeling.  It seems that I can really feel the tires now -- very nice!  The car just feels hooked up; maybe a tiny bit more traction, but I can really feel when the tires start to really lose their grip.\r\n  \r\n  The true test will come this Friday when I'm driving with <a href='http://trackmasters-racing.com/'>Track Masters</a> at <a href='http://infineonraceway.com/'>Infineon Raceway</a>.  The next Friday, I'm going up to Willows to drive with <a href='http://pdcracing.net/'>PDC</a> at <a href='http://thunderhill.com/'>Thunderhill</a>, then the next day is a <a href='http://www.justracing.com/ggc_bmw_cca/viewtopic.php?t=278'>BMWCCA Autocross</a>.  So the car will really be put through its paces over the next week and a half.  My hope is that the additional communication at the limit will give me the confidence to explore the outer bounds of traction, and to make track days more fun!\n:title: New FCABs and RTABs or The Search for Steering Feel\n:excerpt: We tell the story of one man's quest to make a BMW feel like a Porsche.

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  PDC is a casual group of track junkies organized by Mark Dadgar, who is also\r\n  the driving events coordinator for the Golden Gate Chapter of the BMW Car Club\r\n  of America.  He also runs <a href='http://justracing.com/'>justracing.com</a>\r\n  and races a J-Prepared 325i with BMW Club Racing.\r\n  \r\n  Mark has three rules about who is allowed to drive with his group: \r\n  <ol> \r\n  <li>The person must have 10 days of on-track experience, with at least a few of them\r\n  \"signed off\" driving solo.  </li>\r\n  <li>The person must not be an idiot.  </li>\r\n  <li>The person must be referred by a current PDC memeber.  </li>\r\n  </ol> \r\n  Up until last week, I only (barely) met rule #2.  With only 9 days on track, I\r\n  was one short of the first.  Arturo drives with PDC whenever he can, so rule #3\r\n  was a shoe-in.\r\n  \r\n  In a simultaneous event, Arturo managed to convince Mark that he could relax\r\n  rule #1 and I signed up for a day at Infineon Raceway with TrackMasters Racing.\r\n  So I was set -- PDC here I come!\r\n  \r\n  After having dinner with Arti's parents in Pleasanton, Arturo and I caravaned\r\n  up to Willows on Thursday night.  We stayed at the Amerihost, which is a step\r\n  up from my usual fare at the Best Western.  We arrived at about 10:30, and\r\n  turned in shortly after to sleep.  After a quick but huge breakfast at the\r\n  Black Bear Diner, we were off to the track.  \r\n  \r\n  I had some doubts about how well the event would go, since there were 50\r\n  drivers of somewhat varying skill levels (mostly advanced mixed with a few\r\n    \"junior\" members like me), and wildly varying cars -- from a beautiful\r\n  handbuilt Porsche 910 replica, to Miatas, to Porsche 911 GT3 Cup cars, to BMW\r\n  race and street cars, to awesome Radical prototype cars.  The track was open\r\n  from 9AM to 5PM, with no set run groups.  It was basically \"drive whenever you\r\n  want to\".  An all-you-can-eat buffet of sorts...\r\n  \r\n  Once the driving started, all my doubts went away quickly.  This was the best\r\n  trackday yet -- there was not a time when I was behind someone for more than a\r\n  turn or two before passing, and I never felt like I was making the (many, many)\r\n    faster drivers frustrated.  Everyone knew that there was as much track as\r\n    they could consume, so everyone was very relaxed and polite.\r\n  \r\n  My first session felt very sloppy -- it usually takes several laps for me to\r\n  get the rhythm of a track that I'm familiar with, and this was no exception.\r\n  The car felt great with the recent bushing replacement, but I was just a bit\r\n  off.  The second session was a bit better.  Arturo came along, which helped\r\n  quite a bit.  His advice was right on, and helped me to recall some of the\r\n  secrets of Thunderhill.  We had a scary moment coming out of Turn 6 (3rd gear,\r\n    probably 70 MPH) -- as I was accelerating past the apex of the turn, the car\r\n  just went into an odd oversteering condition.  Luckily I managed to keep the\r\n  car on track, but this was to be a recurring theme for the day...\r\n  \r\n  I went out with Arturo in his car and got to experience firsthand the joy of\r\n  being in an early 70's era 911 at speed.  The car is just so wonderfully\r\n  communicative, and with Arturo's expertise behind the wheel it would just dance\r\n  around the track.  Driving that car seems to be much more involved than driving\r\n  a modern car, but that's where the fun is at the track!\r\n  \r\n  Subsequent sessions were starting to feel really good.  I was getting the hang\r\n  of the track a bit better, and experimenting with carrying more speed through\r\n  Turn 8.  I started out at around 85MPH and worked my way up to about 95MPH, but\r\n  I know the car could do it at least five, maybe 10 MPH faster than I was\r\n  willing to negotiate it.  Turn 9 is suprisingly fast, but being that the exit\r\n  point is not visible as you enter the turn, I usually don't take it anywhere\r\n  near the car's limit.  Maybe next time!\r\n  \r\n  During one of my solo sessions, I had another little bobble coming out of Turn\r\n  6 -- just some very slight oversteer, but it was still very odd.  The car would\r\n  not get upset like that in any other turn.\r\n  \r\n  In the afternoon, I had a long session with Joe Colicchi (Tony's younger\r\n    brother) in the passenger seat.  We were about to come in to the pits when\r\n  Arturo in his 911 Carrera RS whizzed by in a pack of spec Miatas.  I couldn't\r\n  let this opportunity pass -- the car was feeling great, and I thought that\r\n  maybe I could try to keep up.  WRONG.  Exiting Turn 15, Arturo just started\r\n  pulling away.  The speed that he carries through the turns is significantly\r\n  higher than me, so by turn 5 he was completely out of my reach.  Oh well, one\r\n  day Arturo I'll get you!\r\n  \r\n  After lamenting over my tires' lack of grip with Arturo after that session, he\r\n  suggested that I get Tony Colicchio to take me around the track in my car.\r\n  Tony is a master of all kinds of things motorsport -- from being the best roll\r\n  cage designer and builder in the Bay Area (or more), to being an expert in\r\n  suspension design and setup, to being a pro race driver, Tony does it all.\r\n  Thankfully, he entertained my request for some laps in the car.\r\n  \r\n  This was an awesome experience -- he was taking the car far deeper to its\r\n  limits than I thought was possible, and with such skill and grace.  His hands\r\n  were always relaxed at the wheel, and I could really feel him shifting the\r\n  car's weight around the make it do what he intended.  After complimenting him\r\n  on his \"beautifully smooth\" driving coming out of Turn 5, he proceeded to find\r\n  the same snap oversteer that I had been experiencing all day.  He was going\r\n  fast enough, though, that recovery was not possible and we ended up going\r\n  backwards off the track.  The car got a little dusty, but was otherwise fine.\r\n  He mentioned that the rear toe setting was probably not optimal, and that I\r\n  should bring it by his shop for a quick adjustment this coming week.  I will\r\n  definitely do this.\r\n  \r\n  Friday brought a couple of firsts for me:  \r\n  \r\n  First of all, it was my first time using a HANS device on track.  Schroth\r\n  recently came out with a set of clip-in belts that are HANS-compatible.  The\r\n  belts are designed for use in cars without a roll cage, and use patented\r\n  Anti-Submarining (ASM) technology in a shoulder belt to keep the occupant from\r\n  sliding under the lap belt in a frontal collision.  The HANS device fits over\r\n  the drivers shoulders, under the shoulder belts, and attaches to the helmet\r\n  with nylon straps.  Its purpose is to keep the driver's helmeted head from\r\n  moving too far forward in a hard crash.  The additional weight of the helmet,\r\n  combined with harnesses that keep the driver's shoulders against the seatback\r\n  can lead to unusual forces on the driver's neck in a hard impact.  These\r\n  forces can be enough to \"disconnect\" a person's brain stem from the brain.\r\n  Death is quick, and guaranteed.  The HANS has saved many lives, and its cost\r\n  is easy to justify, given the cost of modifications to the car that make it\r\n  go faster.  I modified my own helmet to install the posts the HANS attaches\r\n  to.  It was easy with the instructions and hardware provided with the HANS.\r\n  \r\n  Driving with the HANS took a bit of getting used to.  First off, I could only\r\n  rotate my head 45 degrees to either side, which made backing out of the pit\r\n  stall difficult.  On-track, this range of motion was just fine, even in tight\r\n  turns.  A few times I realized that one of the shoulder belts had slipped off\r\n  the HANS, so I started wearing the shoulders a bit tighter.  That fixed the\r\n  problem.\r\n  \r\n  The other first came about halfway through the day.  I had gotten a little\r\n  tired of feeling the traction control kicking in, and thought that maybe it\r\n  would be OK to turn it off.  When autocrossing the M3, I always turn it off,\r\n  and I feel like I can control the rear end of the car pretty well now.  So\r\n  halfway through one of my solo sessions, I turned off DSC and backed down my\r\n  speed by a couple notches.  WOW!  What a great difference!  I felt more\r\n  control over the car, and its movements just felt more natural and\r\n  intentional.  Quickly I was back on my earlier pace, and slowly worked up a\r\n  little more speed.  The M3's balance allows for nicely controlled slides\r\n  (usually!) so switching DSC off, with requisite respect for what the gas\r\n  pedal is capable of works out well.\r\n  \r\n  I'm signed up to return to Thunderhill at the end of August with BMWCCA, and am\r\n  very excited to get back out there.  It's such a fun track that is deceptively\r\n  fast.  I'll also be watching for future PDC events -- there's nothing like a\r\n  great group of people to make a trackday enjoyable.\n:title: Thunderhill with PDC\n:excerpt: Back from a great day at the track with a small group of junkies known as \"PDC\".\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  Just finished putting together some pieces for my \"2.0\" version in-car setup.\r\n  \r\n  For my previous trackday at Thunderhill last weekend, I built a camera mount for the roof to get a good view of the car's line on the track.  In-car footage doesn't let you really assess how close to curbs you're getting, but putting the camera on the roof does.  \r\n  <br><a href=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060814-roof_mount_2.0/?CRW_1997.jpg\"><IMG src=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060814-roof_mount_2.0/thumbs/CRW_1997.jpg\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  Click this picture to watch a video:\r\n  <br><a href=\"http://www.thenobot.org/video/watch.php?20060827-thill.mov\"><img src=\"http://www.thenobot.org/video/video.thenobot.org/20060827-thill.mov.jpg\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  One thing I miss with the roof cam is the ability to see what's going on inside the car with the steering wheel, gauges, knees, and head.  Short of getting a Picture-in-picture box, I decided to put the camera back inside the car.\r\n  <br><a href=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060903-car_cam/?CRW_2262.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060903-car_cam/thumbs/CRW_2262.jpg\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  With the lipstick camera, I have to keep the camcorder somewhere in the car other than my usual mount.  With the roof-cam, I had it stuffed in the glove box, but I don't really like the safety aspect of the weak glove box latch.\r\n  \r\n  I had the idea last night to use the bolts that hold the seat down to attach a bracket.  The bracket would then use the tripod mount on the camcorder to hold it close to the floor.\r\n  <br><a href=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060903-car_cam/?CRW_2259.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060903-car_cam/thumbs/CRW_2259.jpg\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  Another problem with in-car footage is that the camera doesn't know to expose for the car interior, thus washing out the bright exterior; or vice-versa.  I saw that a couple fellow trackjunkies had attached sunglasses material to their cameras to shade the top half (where the windshield is in the image), to balance the image intensity.  I was talking with my wife about this, and she suggested using window tint on the clear glass lens protector.  \r\n  <br><a href=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060903-car_cam/?CRW_2268.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060903-car_cam/thumbs/CRW_2268.jpg\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  I made two versions of this, one with a single layer of tint, one with two layers.  In my limited tests, the single layer seems to work well.  I haven't tried the double layer yet.\r\n  <br><a href=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060903-car_cam/?nofilter.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060903-car_cam/thumbs/nofilter.jpg\" height=80></a>\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060903-car_cam/?filter1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060903-car_cam/thumbs/filter1.jpg\" height=80></a>\r\n  \r\n  Here is a video from inside the car at Thunderhill Raceway:<br>\r\n  <a href='http://www.thenobot.org/video/watch.php?20060913-thill.mov'><img src='http://www.thenobot.org/video/video.thenobot.org/20060913-thill.mov.jpg'></a>\r\n  \r\n  More photos and descriptions of the setup are \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.thenobot.org/pictures/20060903-car_cam/\">here</a>.\r\n\n:title: In-Car Camera 2.0\n:excerpt: The latest revision of my quest to get the best possible setup for putting a camera in/on the car.\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  NASA held its annual \"25 Hours of Thunderhill\" race this past Saturday and\r\n  Sunday.  It is an endurance race where teams race continuously from 11am on\r\n  Saturday until noon on Sunday.  The team that completes the most laps\r\n  during that time is the winner.\r\n  \r\n  I got involved with this pretty much by luck.  It started when I read an\r\n  article that announced Car &amp; Driver and BMW of North America would be\r\n  campaigning two 335d's at the race.  The BMW 335d is a Europe-only 3-series\r\n  sedan with a 3.0 liter twin-turbo diesel engine.  It makes north of 400 lbs-ft\r\n  of torque just above 1000 RPM!  Needless tgo say, it's a performance car\r\n  through and through.  BMW is considering selling their diesel lineup in the USA\r\n  starting in 2008, so they wanted to use this event to introduce their\r\n  technology to Americans.  Car &amp; Driver also saw this an opportunity to \r\n  write up a very unique story and convinced BMW to add some of their biggest names\r\n  to the driver roster, hence the partnership.\r\n  \r\n  When I heard that one of the 335d race cars would be testing at a trackday that \r\n  I was already planning to attend, I got pretty excited.  It's not every day that\r\n  a person like me gets to drive on the same track at the same time as a car that\r\n  is about to become as famous as these cars.  \r\n  \r\n  At the Thunderhill testing day, I waited until the 335d was in the paddock and\r\n  approached with my camera in hand.  I recognized the team manager, Marshall Pruett, from photos\r\n  that I had seen.  I introduced myself, and asked him if I could take some pics of the\r\n  car and put them on my site.  He agreed wholeheartedly, and encouraged me to\r\n  take as many as I liked.  This was definitely a marketing exercise!\r\n  \r\n  At the end of the day, I talked a bit more with Marshall about the cars.  I shared with \r\n  him just how cool I thought the project was, and promised to send him a link to the \r\n  photos and video once they were online.\r\n  \r\n  After sending him the message, he wrote back with an offer I couldn't refuse.  Due to the \r\n  time crunch getting the cars ready for the 25 hour race, the group building the\r\n  cars needed some additional hands to help finish them up.  He wondered if I'd be \r\n  willing to spend some time in the shop (Impact Engineering in San Jose, CA) helping out.\r\n  Uhhhh, OK!  With Arti's blessing and encouragement, I spent several weekend days and weeknights\r\n  over at Impact doing various things to the cars -- suspension stuff, brake\r\n  stuff, and electrical stuff.\r\n  \r\n  The week leading up to the race found the team really scrambling to finish up the cars.  They had\r\n  been shipped to Impact as street cars, and needed to be stripped, caged,\r\n  painted, prepped, and decal'd as race cars.  BMW Engineering had shipped two new engines to the shop that were tuned to produce over 500 ft-lbs of torque!  I think the team worked around the clock for most of the\r\n  week, given all the preparation work that needed to be done.  It was fun to work with the \r\n  Impact guys (Phil, Doug, Dave, and Anthony) and with the other \"voulnteers\" on the project (Lance and Marco).\r\n  \r\n  Since this was a big-name effort, the parts that we installed on the cars were\r\n  all top-notch.  Moton 4-way shocks, TC Design aluminum suspension arms,\r\n  spherical mounts, and strut tower bar, BBS wheels, Recaro HANS seat, etc.\r\n  These cars were basically a track junkie's dream come true.  \r\n  \r\n  While working on the cars, Marshall offered me a spot in the pit crew for the\r\n  race.  This took a bit more consideration, since I'd be gone for 3 days and 2\r\n  nights.  There's not much in Willows for Arti and Marina to do, so I was going\r\n  to be away from them.  Again, Arti was incredibly supportive of this\r\n  opportinity, and encouraged me to take him up on the offer if I was into it.\r\n  Well, I was!\r\n  \r\n  I drove up to the track, leaving at 6am on Friday.  Phil from Impact rode with\r\n  me.  The drive up there went by very fast ... usually I make that drive solo,\r\n    so it gets pretty long.  Having good company makes all the difference!\r\n  \r\n  We arrived shortly after 8am.  The team had a couple of RV's, as well as a semi\r\n  truck that brought the cars and most of the supplies.  The white car and most\r\n  of the stuff had already been unloaded.  The grey car was still in the truck,\r\n    and was getting a new differential from diffsonline.com installed.  I took\r\n    some time to meet and talk with the other guys on the team.  Some I had only\r\n    \"met\" online, others were brand new.\r\n  \r\n  I set up the \"setup pad\" -- which is a perfectly level surface that the car\r\n  drives onto  with scales under each tire.  It's used to do critical alignment\r\n  and corner balance changes, since the paddock surface is pretty sloped and\r\n  bumpy.  I also helped to set up the pit areas, positioning the fuel filling\r\n  tanks that I had assembled back at Impact, moving tools and spares down to the\r\n  area, and setting up and securing EZ-ups to give some protection from the sun.\r\n  \r\n  The cars were ready to take the track for some practice after noon on Friday,\r\n    which was much later than we had planned.  The diff took longer than had\r\n    anticipated, as well as other issues with both cars kept them in the paddock\r\n    surrounded by mechanics.\r\n  \r\n  We worked until about 8pm on Friday prepping and checking the cars, and were\r\n  happy to retire to the comfort of the hotel to get some much-needed sleep (I\r\n    had only slept about 5 hours the night prior).  I was rooming with Brad\r\n  Otoupalik, who started Evosport.  I had talked with him several times before on\r\n  the phone and through email, and it was great to meet him face-to-face.  He's\r\n  got a lot of valuable insight into the world of motorsports, and I enjoyed\r\n  talking with him in our room.\r\n  \r\n  I met up with Phil and Doug from Impact Saturday morning for coffee and some\r\n  breakfast at the diner at the Willows airport.  I figured we'd need a good\r\n  high-calorie breakfast to endure the long long day ahead.  We got to the track\r\n  a bit after 7am, and started working on the cars and setting up the area\r\n  immediately.  We all changed into our uniforms, which were a sweet setup of\r\n  Alpinestars firesuits, driving shoes, and gloves, we got started.\r\n  \r\n  The cars needed to be on-grid by 11am.  The team qualified in 5th (grey car)\r\n  and 13th (white car) the previous day.  It was great to see them lined up\r\n  with the rest of the field in anticipation of the race.  After a stunt\r\n  aerobatics show, an Air Force honor guard display, and an AWESOME flyover of\r\n  three F-15 fighter jets, we got serious about racing.\r\n  \r\n  The start of the race was an emotional release for a lot of us who had worked\r\n  on the cars.  I can only imagine how much more intense the feelings were from the\r\n  guys who really poured their blood and sweat into the cars over the past couple of \r\n  months.\r\n  \r\n  However, the happiness was short-lived.  The white car (\"my\" car), which hadn't\r\n  been out on track much before, melted a piston after only a handful of laps.\r\n  It came limping back to the pits belching white smoke.  The diagnosis came\r\n  quickly -- terminal engine failure.  We had to install the spare motor.\r\n  \r\n  The team sprang into action.  Three guys were instrumental in getting the car\r\n  back to action.  Mark from Evosport lended his skilled hands to the process,\r\n    and Thomas and ___, the two Austrian engineers from BMW.  Those guys just\r\n    ripped into removing the old motor like they had done it a thousand times.  I\r\n    hadn't been involved in an engine swap before, so I was watching as much as\r\n    possible what they were doing.  I helped as much as I could, but that was\r\n    mostly limited to muscling heavy parts around or finding tools for the guys\r\n    doing the \"real\" work.\r\n  \r\n  They got the new motor installed in less than 4 hours from when the car pulled\r\n  off the track.  The replacement engine fired up immediately -- without even an\r\n  extended cranking / cursing / cross-your-fingers period.  Amazing stuff!\r\n  \r\n  The car went right back on track, but radioed in a few minutes later that it\r\n  was overheating.  We were crushed!  Back in it came, and the cooling system was\r\n  removed in minutes by the afforementioned wizards.  The radiator checked out\r\n  OK, as did the rest of the hoses.  The guys removed the thermostat, just for\r\n  good measure, and buttoned everything up.  They filled and bled the system with\r\n  great care, and the car went back out.  No more coolant system issues after\r\n  that.\r\n  \r\n  Throughout the race, I changed tires, was the jack man, and replaced brake pads\r\n  during various pit stops.  It's quite an adrenaline rush to be working under\r\n  such intense pressure, and it helped to have so much experience and skill\r\n  around me.\r\n  \r\n  As the day wore on, we were treated to catered meals in the \"hospitality\" area\r\n  under the big awning attached to the semi.  The food was really good, and quite\r\n  hearty.  I think we all appreciated this small detail.\r\n  \r\n  I had planned for a bitter cold night.  Previous days that week had seen lows\r\n  of 28 degrees Fahrenheit.  Friday night was extremely windy.  However, the gods\r\n  were smiling upon our long, long race with weather as lovely as we could hope for\r\n  on Saturday night.  Little to no wind, and temperatures not much below 38 degrees.\r\n  \r\n  I spent most of the night alternating between pitting the cars and taking photos\r\n  of the race.  The diesels had large fuel tanks (34 gallons), great fuel economy\r\n  (9-10 MPG), and tires that could go for 6+ hours between changes, so there were\r\n  a couple of times where we'd have a couple of hours of quiet time.  I took my\r\n  camera gear and tripod to different spots on the track to play with some night \r\n  photography.  I think I came back with some fun stuff.\r\n  \r\n  The pit crew thinned out over the course of the night.  I think some guys found\r\n  some really cozy spots in the RV!  I stayed on until about 5:30AM, with the aid\r\n  of a cup of coffee every hour, and then decided it was in everyone's best\r\n  interest if I took a little snooze.  \r\n  \r\n  The RV was pretty much full, so I got into the car and reclined the seat as much\r\n  as it could go.  I faded in and out of sleep until about 6:15AM, then realized that \r\n  I was freezing.  I turned on the car and blasted the heater to get my temperature \r\n  back up, then headed back to the pits.  Not much sleep.  Big mistake.\r\n  \r\n  Crewmembers slowly reappeared as the sun rose over the track.  It was beautiful\r\n  out there, with Mt. Shasta looming in the distance over Turn 6 illuminated first.  \r\n  \r\n  The white car radioed in that it had been hit by another car.  The driver had thought\r\n  that a tire was cut, and he was coming into the pits.  We all got a shot of adrenaline\r\n  and lept into action.  We got a new tire ready, and waited behind the pit wall.  The car\r\n  pulled in, and the tire looked just fine.  We pulled it off to find that a bolt holding\r\n  the suspension to the wheel hub had sheared, thus making the car feel awful in the corners.\r\n  There was a mad scramble to find a replacement bolt, and we were back on track.  \r\n  \r\n  That is pretty much where I hit the wall.\r\n  \r\n  After 20 hours of standing, running, lifting, thinking, and shouting, I was\r\n  kaput.  The pits seemed that they'd be quiet for some time, so I decided to\r\n  head back to the hotel and take a shower or sleep a little bit.  I was a man\r\n  posessed with this idea, so I quietly slipped away to go recharge.  In\r\n  retrospect, I should have asked my buddies from Impact if they wanted to come\r\n  too, since they had been working as hard or harder than me through this time.\r\n  Sorry guys for not thinking of that at the time!  I left for the hotel at 8am,\r\n  showered, and soaked in the tub for 20 minutes or so.  This was just what I\r\n  needed.  Fresh socks, underwear, and a shirt, and I was back in business in\r\n  my uniform.  I stopped at Starbucks to get a double short latte on the way back\r\n  to the track.   I got back at 9am, refreshed and ready to finish the race.\r\n  \r\n  Only 15 minutes before the end of the race, there was another suspension\r\n  failure, this time in the ever-reliable grey car.  This one was a bit more\r\n  spectacular, since the shock absorber broke as well as a bolt holding the\r\n  suspension arm to the hub.  The car limped back to the pits, barely able to\r\n  drive in a straight line.  The team's collective problem solving skills were\r\n  amazing as ever.  We decided that the car would finish the race, but with no\r\n  spring or shock in that corner.  The crew zip-tied the flopping suspension arm \r\n  to the hub, just to keep it from destroying anything else, and removed the failed\r\n  shock shaft and spring.  They set the car down so that the shock body would rest\r\n  on the beefy lower suspension arm (suspension travel, anyone?).  This worked \r\n  like a charm.  \r\n  \r\n  With 4 minutes to go in the race, we were in 4th place exiting the pits and\r\n  enough laps ahead of the 5th place car so that we could keep our position.  One\r\n  slow lap around the track, and we were done!  The team bosses radioed the two cars to\r\n  cross the finish line side-by-side (photo op, anyone?).  High fives and hugs\r\n  were exchanged all around.  Given the problems that these cars saw, we were\r\n  stoked that they both drove across the finish line 25 hours after the start of the race.\r\n  \r\n  It's now Tuesday morning as I finish writing this.  My body is not as sore as\r\n  it was Sunday night, and my feet are less bruised up.  My chapped lips are now\r\n  peeling, which is a welcome event.  I no longer smell of diesel fuel or hear\r\n  the roar of race car engines echoing off the hills around Willows inside my\r\n  head.  I went to sleep at a normal time last night, and woke up at a normal\r\n  time this morning.  I keep thinking back to the excitement and intense\r\n  comraderie of our team, and the fact that we kept those cars working for so\r\n  long.  I'm still amazed that I was able to be a part of it.  \r\n  \r\n  Everyone tells me that this was the toughest 25 Hour that they had been a part of.\r\n  Cool!  So how long until next year's race?  Anyone need a tire and jack guy?\n:title: 25 Days of Thunderhill\n:excerpt: I managed to hook up with the Car and Driver / BMW of North America team that raced in the 25 Hours of Thunderhill endurance race in two 335d Diesel race cars.\n"

They had an idea for a new mode of communication that filled the space between having a phone conversation and sending an email.  Pinger merges the strengths of both -- the speed and content of a voice message, but with the convenience features of an email.\r\n  \r\n  To send a Pinger message, you simply dial the special \"send\" phone number, say the name of the person in your address book you want to send a message to, then say your message.\r\n  \r\n  8 seconds later, the recipient receives a text message on their phone with a number to dial to retrieve the message.  On my phone, I merely hit \"send\" while looking at the text message, and the phone will dial the number.  The message plays immediately for the recipient.  No menu prompts (\"Press 1 to listen to messages, Press 2 to blah blah...\"), no delay.\r\n  \r\n  To reply to the message, the recipient presses \"1\", speaks the reply, then hangs up.\r\n  \r\n  You can define groups of people in your Pinger contact list, which allows you to broadcast a message to many people at once.  I think this is a killer feature -- imagine sending a voice message to everyone on your basketball team or mom's group with a single swift action.  Group message recipients can reply back to you, or to the whole group.\r\n  \r\n  Just like email, your Pinger messages can be viewed (listened to) on the computer, and are presented as threaded discussions.  You can send a Pinger message from the computer too, all you need is a microphone.\r\n  \r\n  I think this idea has a future, and am excited to work in a small, focused company.  I'll be Pinger's 4th engineer.\r\n  \r\n  Pinger is in the heart of downtown San Jose, a block from about a dozen restaurants, and walking distance to several museums and parks.  It's going to be a shorter commute, both now and when we move to our new place.\r\n  \r\n  <img style='float:right; border:1px solid black' src='/blog_images/yhoo_DSC00238.jpg'>Yahoo! still has a warm place in my heart though.  I didn't leave there because I disliked what I was doing -- in fact, my last job at Y! was the most interesting that I'd had over my time there.  I chose to leave mostly because of the opportunity I see at Pinger, not just in terms of their business success, but for a change in my environment.\r\n  <center><img style='border:1px solid black;' src='/blog_images/yhoo_DSC00241.jpg'></center>\r\n  \r\n  So give Pinger a test drive ... visit <a href='http://pinger.com/'>pinger.com</a> and register for an account.

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  OK, so it was only three months at Pinger.\r\n  \r\n  Here's the story:  About a year ago, I had an idea for a web application that was different from any other web application.  In short, it allows its user to view information from the future, present, and past in a new and different way.  It can help to bring people together, as well as bring more understanding to where we came from.\r\n  \r\n  Sounds like a big idea right?  Well I think it is.\r\n  \r\n  So I worked on this idea for about a month.  I took some time off of work and built a prototype.  I also had long conversations with some trusted friends -- Derek in particular.  He saw the value in this idea, and helped to develop a more engaging product around the core concept.  Unfortunately, he and I had both started new jobs fairly recently and the idea kind of fizzled out.  It stayed in the back of my mind though.\r\n  \r\n  At the beginning of the year, Derek got in touch with me.  Apparently, our common friend BJ had <b>the same idea</b> (roughly).  BJ was dead serious about building a company around the idea, and called Derek to talk about it.  I'm pretty sure Derek's mind was blown at that point.  He got on board with BJ, and then they called me.\r\n  \r\n  Well, I had just started at Pinger, and was just finishing up a savings-account-tapping remodel on our new house.  I was not in a position to take a financial risk (meaning: work without a steady income).  I regrettably declined Derek and BJ's invitation to join them in their venture -- but with the stipulation that I would be on board as soon as I could make a living and have health insurance for my family.\r\n  \r\n  Only a couple of weeks later, they called back with excellent news.  Apparently the few investors that they had talked with got really excited about the product idea, and had made funding commitments.  They were halfway to their initial funding target, and were ready to get me on board.\r\n  \r\n  It was a difficult moment when I told my boss at Pinger that I'd be leaving.  I knew that joining Derek and BJ was what I was going to do -- I never agonized over the decision -- but, it was hard to tell the folks at Pinger that I was going after such a short time.\r\n  \r\n  However, I feel that I was able to contribute to Pinger's product during my time there.  I redid the signup process, incorporating an almost-live connection between the web and a new user's phone call, which was pretty cool.  Hopefully I made an impact in other, more subtle ways.  I met some great people there, and wish them good success.  I still feel that Pinger's time of success will come soon.\r\n  \r\n  Right now, I have my head down writing code to improve my year-old prototype to make it look much better for other prospective investors.  BJ is a kick-ass designer and artist, so he has laid down some great designs for me to follow.  Derek amazes me with his business savvy and his long list of very influential contacts in the technology business.  Even though BJ is in Austin and Derek is in San Francisco, we're able to work together as a tight team.  We have a 3-way video conference every morning (thank you Apple iChat AV!) to give each other an update.  We're chatting on the phone or instant messenger throughout the day as necessary.  This technology works.\r\n  \r\n  I'm really enjoying working on a product that is so dear to my heart, and with great friends.  Speaking of friends, a friend back from the My Yahoo days is on board halftime as of week after next.  Ben is an excellent software engineer and product designer, and will be a huge asset for the company.\r\n  \r\n  I can't really say much about the product now, but will definitely put links up here when we have a release that is fit for public consumption.\r\n\n:title: Goodbye Pinger, Hello ____!\n:excerpt: Springtime brings all kinds of new things.\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |\n  Today we released a big upgrade to Dipity on Facebook.\r\n  \r\n  Previously, you could look at your Facebook Photos and Facebook Events and see a visualization of how you \"connected\" with your friends through these objects.  It was a read-only experience.\r\n  \r\n  With the current release, we've taken a fundamental step forward.  You can now create your own Dipity events.  You can put these events on not only your own personal timeline, but on your friends' timelines too!\r\n  \r\n  We see timelines as storytelling devices -- whether you're telling your own life story, chronicling historical events, or building a fantasy world.  By adding a layer of interactivity (sliding, zooming, and adding multimedia), we've taken timelines from something you likely remember from History class into compelling mechanism for consuming any kind of information.\r\n  \r\n  The <a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/_dipity_/index.php\">Dipity app homepage</a> now shows you a selection of friends who have installed, and who have not yet installed Dipity.  There's also a form to add an event to your timeline.\r\n  \r\n  From the homepage, you can view your own timeline, view a friend's timeline, or compare a set of friends to see when they have done things together.\r\n  \r\n  When you add something to a friend's timeline, they get a notification (usually an email) that you did this, and will likely want to\r\n   visit Dipity to see what you wrote, and hopefully to put something on your timeline in return.\r\n  \r\n  On the profile page, we now push items to your minifeed when you add Dipity events, provide an action item under your profile image, provide a profile page box with a snapshot of the most recently added events to your timeline, and a event quick-add form.\r\n  \r\n  Here are some screenshots so you can see what this is all about:\r\n  \r\n  <div style=\"float:left; text-align:center;padding:5px;\"><a href=\"/blog_images/homepage_big.png\"><img src=\"/blog_images/homepage_small.png\"><br>Home Page</a></div>\r\n  <div style=\"float:left; text-align:center;padding:5px;\"><a href=\"/blog_images/mytimeline_big.png\"><img src=\"/blog_images/mytimeline_small.png\"><br>My Timeline</a></div>\r\n  <div style=\"float:left; text-align:center;padding:5px;\"><a href=\"/blog_images/compare_big.png\"><img src=\"/blog_images/compare_small.png\"><br>Compare Friends</a></div>\r\n  <div style=\"float:left; text-align:center;padding:5px;\"><a href=\"/blog_images/add_big.png\"><img src=\"/blog_images/add_small.png\"><br>Add Event</a></div><div style=\"float:left; text-align:center;padding:5px;\"><a href=\"/blog_images/profile_big.png\"><img src=\"/blog_images/profile_small.png\"><br>Profile Page</a></div>\r\n  <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\r\n  We have now entered the world of content creation.  This is just the beginning though ... we will have several new features in the coming weeks to help people build and discover the Serendipity in their lives!\r\n\n:title: Dipity v2 Released on Facebook\n:excerpt: We have finally come out with our big release on Facebook's Application platform.

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  After checking out what <a href=\"http://opendns.com/\">OpenDNS</a> provides, I was excited to give it a try on my network.  I use a Linksys WRT-54GS with the excellent DD-WRT firmware.  Since the original WRT-54 firmware was Linux based, Linksys had to release the source code to it, which spawned lots of variants offering better feature sets.\r\n  \r\n  DD-WRT gives a lot of control over the router's behavior, and offers nice things like the ability to SSH to the router (it's running Linux, ya know!).  Another nice addition is the use of Dnsmasq to act as a local DNS cache, among other things.  Having a local DNS cache speeds up all internet activity, and can only be a good thing.\r\n  \r\n  Anyhow, back to OpenDNS...\r\n  \r\n  I followed the instructions on the OpenDNS help page for the Linksys WRT-54 router and entered their DNS servers into the boxes for \"Static DNS\" in the router configuration screen.  This works great, but still leaves my ISP's DNS server in the resolv.conf as a backup.  This is great for reliability, but in a lot of cases DNS requests would be answered by Comcast, which defeats the purpose of using OpenDNS.  So I set out to find a different solution that only uses OpenDNS's servers.\r\n  \r\n  One way to acomplish this is to set the DNS servers in each client's TCP/IP configuration.  This works, but has two downsides.  1 - Any new client now needs to be configured.  2 - We lose the benefit of the local cache of Dnsmasq.\r\n  \r\n  After a few failed attempts, I figured out what needs to be done.  In the DD-WRT configuration webpages, click \"Setup\" and enter the \"Basic Setup\" screen.  Put a checkmark in the box next to \"Use DNSMasq for DNS\".  Save the settings.\r\n  \r\n  Now go to the \"Administration\" tab, and click the \"Services\" subtab.  In the \"DNSMasq\" area, within the \"Additional DNS Options\" textbox, enter the following:\r\n  <pre style=\"margin:5px 20px; padding:5px;background:#eee;\">\r\n  no-resolv\r\n  server=208.67.222.222\r\n  server=208.67.222.220\r\n  </pre>\r\n  \r\n  Save the settings, and you will now be using only OpenDNS's servers, and getting the benefit of the local Dnsmasq cache!\n:title: OpenDNS on DD-WRT\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

This past weekend, Derek and I went up to Thunderhill for the SCCA Driver Licensing School.  This is a mandatory step to being able to compete in SCCA road races for those who don't already have a racing license with an accepted organization.  It's a three day school, offering at least two hours of track time per day.  On the last day of the school, the \"final exam\" is in the form of two races with our fellow students.\r\n  \r\n  The week prior to the school is a ground school session where flags are discussed as well as passing rules and some driving technique.  The ground school lasts for three hours and is preceeded by a tech session where those with cars who have never raced with SCCA can have their cars inspected by official scrutineers.  Our Miata was one of only a few cars that day that passed tech without needing additional work.  The scrutineer's comment was \"Finally!  Someone who read the rulebook.\"\r\n  \r\n  <img align=left src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2005/2309625760_cd0dca81aa_m.jpg>Derek and I roped our dads into coming with us to the school.  Between the back-to-back-to-back track and classroom sessions (it's a 3 run group format), there would be little time to set tire pressures, check oil, get the video and data systems ready, set up the seat and belts for the other driver, etc in between.  We could not have done as well as we did without them, let alone do it at all!\r\n  \r\n  We packed up the car Thursday afternoon, and left for Thunderhill in the evening, arriving at the track to drop off the car and \"stuff\" in the paddock at around 8:30pm.  We checked into the hotel at about 9pm, and headed for bed soon after with the alarm set for 6am.\r\n  \r\n  After having a little breakfast at the hotel, and tanking up at Starbucks on the way out, we got to the track at around 7:15am.  The registration process went very smoothly -- the SCCA runs a very tight ship, with loads of very capable voulnteers to handle each task.  After registration we did some prep on the car then went to the first driver's meeting.  We were introduced to our instructors, each of whom had 2-3 students for the weekend, and got the lowdown on how the day would go.\r\n  \r\n  I was assigned to James Thomas, who races a Volvo 142 in ITB, and is a really nice guy.  James' other student was a college student named Philip, who was also driving a Miata.  Philip's dad had been racing in Spec Miata the last year or so, and decided to get his two sons involved.  Good move, Philip's dad!\r\n  \r\n  James took us around the track in his Volvo street car (he owns a <a href=\"http://jtvolvo.com/\">Volvo repair shop</a> in Chico).  He showed us the line and discussed the finer points of the track.  We were not running the full 15-turn 3.0 mile track, but instead the shorter 1.8 mile 9-turn configuration where we make a sharp left turn before the normal T8, and rejoin between T14 and T15.  I was a little bummed about this in the beginning, since T9 in the normal config is one of my favorite turns, but the repition and simplicity of a smaller track was definitely a better choice for this school.  After the slow-speed instructor laps, it was off to suit up and get ready to drive!\r\n  \r\n  The first session had passing limited to the front straight only.  Several people in my group had never been on a race track before which was a suprising thing to me.  The weekend costs a lot in terms of entry fees, preparation, building or renting a car, and time away.  I guess some people \"just know\" they want to race!  \r\n  \r\n  The first couple of sessions were a little frustrating for me, since there were some very long lines of cars -- 15 cars at times -- freight-training around the track.  Having almost 30 days on track, I'm very comfortable with the car, the track layout, and what goes on at the track (driving in close quarters, looking for flaggers, etc) but I do remember how overwhelming my first couple of track days were.  Rather than try to pass 15 cars driving some wild variations of \"the line\", I drove through pit lane a few times looking for an opening in the train, hoping to come out of the pits just before \"the engine\".  The organizers opened up passing to the whole track on the final session of Friday, and that's where things started to get REALLY fun and I started to be ruined for normal lapping days.\r\n  \r\n  The SCCA mandates that when making a pass, both drivers are responsible for ensuring contact doesn't occur.  They specify that all cars maintain control and leave \"racing room\" when going side-by-side through a turn.  This sets up a great environment for driving, since neither driver \"owns\" the corner and can thus cannot force the other car off track.  \r\n  \r\n  Turn 2 was one of my favorite places to do passing.  It's a turn where the Miata really shines, since the car can enter at a pretty high speed and maintain a tight line all the way around the turn.  Sometimes I'd go into the turn side-by-side with someone, and pass them as we drove through the turn.  Tons of fun!  I also did some passing into T1 (just slow down a bit more than usual and take a tighter line), T3 (take either the tight line through the turn making sure to be ahead of the other person before T4, or taking the outside line with a better setup for the T4 apex), T6 (inside line is very nice with a lot of grip), and coming out of T9/15 with enough of a head of steam to pass on the front straight -- but that only works on other Miatas, since other cars have a better power-to-weight ratio.\r\n  \r\n  This kind of passing was a very liberating experience, and felt no more dangerous than other open passing trackdays that I had done.  Because all the participants had a similar expectation of how things would work, there were no surprises.  In a couple of the download sessions on Friday and Saturday, the organizers encouraged us to do MORE passing and to be MORE aggressive!  I had never gotten that kind of encouragement before at the track.\r\n  \r\n  I took 5 seconds off my time from Friday to Saturday, then another 2 seconds off from Saturday to Sunday.  The desire of wanting to be in front of someone (racing) versus wanting to get clear track (lapping days) was a big factor in that improvement, I think.  Derek did well too, taking off similar amounts of time from day to day.\r\n  \r\n  The last sessions of the day on Saturday we got to do a couple of practice race starts.  It was really cool to be following a pace car around the track, warming up the brakes and tires, then lining up two abreast on the front straight anticipating the green flag and dropping the hammer when the flag flew and looking for openings to gain position.  Tons of fun -- and a dream come true!\r\n  \r\n  We did a normal practice session Sunday morning, then another practice race start session after that.  Just before lunch was the first of the two races that would cap the school's curriculum.  It was a neat experience, doing a real start followed by 30 minutes of very intense driving.  I was gridded in 8th position (the grid was kind of arbitrarily chosen), and managed to pass a handful of cars on the first lap.  I was working on on one more -- passing him on the ouside in T9, but the guy didn't leave me room at the exit and I had to slow down so as to not be forced off the track.  Because of the slowdown, three cars were able to get by me on the front straight which really steamed me -- I'd have to work at getting by the same people again!  Through the rest of the race, I did reel in the cars I had originally passed, and ended up in 10th place.  \r\n  \r\n  <img align=right src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3111/2308832557_355df60834_m.jpg>Derek had two clean races but unfortunately the car was spewing coolant after his 2nd race (just prior to my 2nd race), so the car's day was done.  I frantically looked for one of the organizers to explain the situation, and maybe rent a car for the 2nd race which was starting in 5 minutes.  After explaining the situation, the guy in charge of our group radioed in and said not to worry about it, he would pass me anyway.  I had mixed feelings -- on one hand, I was happy to be able to relax after a very long and tiring weekend, but on the other hand, I wanted to race again!\r\n  \r\n  Derek and the dads packed up the truck while I watched my groupmates in their 2nd race.  Philip did really well, leading the race for several laps.  I really wanted to be out there dicing with him!  After our graduation ceremony, we hit the highway and were back home at around 8pm.\r\n  \r\n  I really can't wait to get the car fixed, and prepped for our first race which is the last weekend in March at Infineon Raceway.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/thenobot/sets/72157604038853668/\">Pictures</a>  - <a href=\"http://thenobot.org/video/watch.php?20080229-scca_school_highlights.mov\">Video</a> from the school.\n:title: Ruined\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

It was asking me over and over, \\\"who do you think you are?\\\"\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  At that moment, I woke up with my heart racing. \\xC2\\xA0I was sweating, breathing heavily, and really bothered inside.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  That was really the turning point. \\xC2\\xA0We had been eating veg maybe one or two nights a week, but that dream marked when I got more serious about not eating meat.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  There are lots of good reasons not to eat meat, not the least of which is avoiding causing pain and anguish in another animal. \\xC2\\xA0Environmental reasons, health reasons, kitchen-hygene reasons all point to going veg. \\xC2\\xA0On the other hand, lots of folks enjoy the taste of meat in their food -- fair enough.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  I definitely found it hard to give up eating certain things -- not having sausage in lasagna or pizza was a biggie. \\xC2\\xA0The longer I stay away from meat though, the less I crave it. \\xC2\\xA0I'm actually kind of grossed out by chicken now -- I've had it here and there and can really taste the chicken coop in it.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  I'll make an occasional exception though. \\xC2\\xA0If I'm at someone's house and they don't know I'm veg, I'll usually not say anything because I'm not a veg-zealot and I'm not *so* grossed out as to make a scene. \\xC2\\xA0An infrequent trip to a Ramen house or Vietnamese Pho restaurant is also a time where I'll de-cloak from vegetarianism.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Anyhow, that's the story. \\xC2\\xA0Hopefully we'll now get back to more interesting posts...\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  UPDATE 2014-10-23 - It's been about five years since I've had any meat.

  data: "--- \n:excerpt: Programmatically generate vertically-oriented text on any web page using HTML.\n:title: Easy Vertical Text Online\n:content: |-\n  A few weeks back, I was doing a project where I needed to display a table of information with many columns on a web page.  The value in each cell was a short word, but the labels for each column could be long.  \n  \n  <table border=\"1\">\n     <tr>\n       <th>&nbsp;</th>\n       <th>Something Number One</th>\n       <th>Something Number Two</th>\n       <th>Something Number Three</th>\n       <th>Something Number Four</th>\n       <th>Something Number Five</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Server 1</th>\n      <td>BAD</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n      <td>BAD</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Server 2</th>\n      <td>OK</td>\n      <td>BAD</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n  \n  With typical HTML, this would mean the data table would stretch too wide (horizontal scrolling), or I'd need to use a very small (illegible?) type size on the column headers.\n  \n  If I could make the column headers vertical, then the space issue would be resolved.  The only browser that can rotate text on the fly is Safari 3, so the only other typical choice would be to render the text as an image in Photoshop or similar software.\n  \n  Poking through the PHP GD library manual pages, I found my answer -- I could render text using PHP/GD on the fly, and deliver it to the client in &lt;img&gt; tags.  I implemented a solution for my app, but then decided that I could make this more widely available.  So <a href=\"http://vtext.info/\">vtext.info</a> was born.\n  \n  Here is that same data table, but with <a href=\"http://vtext.info/\">vertical text generated on the fly by vtext.info</a>:\n  \n  <table border=\"1\">\n     <tr>\n       <th>&nbsp;</th>\n       <th valign=\"bottom\"><img src=\"http://vtext.info/img?string=Something+Number+One&color=000000&bgcolor=FFFFFF&face=Sans\" alt=\"Something Number One\" /></th>\n       <th valign=\"bottom\"><img src=\"http://vtext.info/img?string=Something+Number+Two&color=000000&bgcolor=FFFFFF&face=Sans\"  alt=\"Something Number Two\" /></th>\n       <th valign=\"bottom\"><img src=\"http://vtext.info/img?string=Something+Number+Three&color=000000&bgcolor=FFFFFF&face=Sans\"  alt=\"Something Number Three\" /></th>\n       <th valign=\"bottom\"><img src=\"http://vtext.info/img?string=Something+Number+Four&color=000000&bgcolor=FFFFFF&face=Sans\"  alt=\"Something Number Four\" /></th>\n       <th valign=\"bottom\"><img src=\"http://vtext.info/img?string=Something+Number+Five&color=000000&bgcolor=FFFFFF&face=Sans\"  alt=\"Something Number Five\" /></th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Server 1</th>\n      <td>BAD</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n      <td>BAD</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Server 2</th>\n      <td>OK</td>\n      <td>BAD</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n      <td>OK</td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n  \n  So now anyone can programatically generate rotated text in any color, and choosing from a set of basic fonts.  The image tag above looks like this:\n  <code>\n    &lt;img src=\"http://vtext.info/img?string=Something+Number+Five&color=000000&bgcolor=FFFFFF&face=Sans\"  alt=\"Something Number Five\" &gt;\n  </code>\n  So it should be easy to see how to programmatically change the text, color, or font face.\n  \n  <a href=\"http://vtext.info/\"><img src=\"http://thenobot.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-5-300x167.png\" alt=\"vtext.info screenshot\" title=\"vtext.info screenshot\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" /></a>\n  \n  The system has a built-in caching layer, so I don't get squeamish if someone decides to use the img tag format above.\n  \n  Please let me know what you think of this!  Maybe someone else will find it useful.\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  I started a job a few weeks ago where we're using Ruby on Rails.  I had never used it before, and am starting to learn why it has been able to grow as quickly as it has -- it's just damn cool in a lot of ways.\r\n  \r\n  One technique we used a lot in my previous company was to allocate a column in a database to be a \"catch-all\" for various attributes, in the form of a serialized hash.  The advantage here is that if we want to add an attribute to a table, we would not need to alter the table unless we absolutely had to in order to facilitate SELECTs or ORDERing.  When we'd read a row from the table, we would de-serialize that column and make that hash available to whatever uses it.  \r\n  \r\n  Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord class handles this seamlessly.  Just tell your model to serialize the column like so:\r\n  <pre>class MyModelClass < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    <strong>serialize :data</strong>\r\n  end</code></pre>\r\n  <strong>data</strong> is the name of the column that holds the serialized data.\r\n  \r\n  If you want to enforce the type of data that can be serialized/deserialized, add the type name:\r\n  <pre>class MyModelClass < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    serialize :data<strong>, MyDataClass</strong>\r\n  end</pre>\r\n  \r\n  You can then call methods on the object represented in the <strong>data</strong> column by referencing it like this:\r\n  <pre>row = MyModelClass.find :first\r\n  row.data.foobar</pre>\r\n  assuming <strong>MyDataClass</strong> implements a method called <strong>foobar</strong>.\r\n  \r\n  So far so good right?  Well, let's say MyDataClass implements a nice object-model of a hash, so calling MyDataClass#keyname will return the value referenced by the key.  You write a bunch of views referencing row.data.foobar or row.data.snafu, but at a later date you decide that you really want to dedicate a column in the database table to the value held by data.foobar.  So you have to visit all your views to be sure you make the change from row.data.foobar to row.foobar.  Crappy!\r\n  \r\n  Wouldn't it be nice to just design it from the start so that you could call <strong>row.foobar</strong>?  That way, it's at the model's discretion whether a bit of data is stored in the serialized column or a \"real\" column.  Nice, right?\r\n  \r\n  Well, it's pretty easy to do.  We'll define a Mix-In that we'll load into certain model classes.  This mix-in will override the <strong>method_missing</strong> and <strong>respond_to?</strong> methods of the class with our own design.  \r\n  \r\n  Here is the content of <strong>lib/model_data_column.rb</strong>:\r\n  <pre>## \r\n  # Model Data Column Mix-In\r\n  # Include this in your data model if you use 'data' as a serialized object.\r\n  # This will let you call \"model.foo\" rather than \"model.data.foo\"\r\n  # to facilitate moving data between the serialized 'data' column \r\n  # and real DB columns.\r\n  module ModelDataColumn\r\n  \r\n    def method_missing(method_id, *args)\r\n      self[:data].send(method_id, args) || super\r\n    end\r\n  \r\n    def respond_to?(method_id, *args)\r\n      self[:data].send(:respond_to?, method_id) || \r\n        self[:data].send(:has_key?, method_id.id2name) || \r\n        super\r\n    end\r\n  \r\n  end</pre>\r\n  \r\n  <strong>Note:</strong> the class behind your serialized column (<strong>MyDataClass</strong> in this case) needs to implement the method <strong>has_key?</strong>.\r\n  \r\n  Use it in your model like this:\r\n  <pre><strong>require 'model_data_column'</strong>\r\n  \r\n  class MyModelClass < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    <strong>include ModelDataColumn</strong>\r\n    serialize :data, MyDataClass \r\n  end</pre>\r\n  \r\n  So now you can call methods in your serialized object column without explicitly referencing the column!  This means the rest of your application does not need to concern itself with how the model has implemented the storage of the data.  It will just work.\r\n  \r\n  There is a danger if the serialized column holds a value with the same key as the name of a database column.  The model will always return the value from the DB column in this case.  However, the benefits of this model are big enough for us where we will trade that for the need to keep tabs on the names of things we are storing.\r\n  \r\n  So now this old code:\r\n  <pre>row = MyModelClass.find :first\r\n  row.data.foobar</pre>\r\n  And this new code:\r\n  <pre>row = MyModelClass.find :first\r\n  row.foobar</pre>\r\n  Will have the same output.

Simple!  <a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/allsats.asp?Mag=3.5&lat=37.339&lng=-121.894&loc=San+Jose&alt=24&tz=PST\">Here is a page</a> that lists very bright objects visible from San Jose, CA.  If you alter the minimum brightness value (a higher magnitude number), then more items will be listed.  All kinds of satellites are up there.  From communications satellites, to weather tracking devices, to the bodies of rockets used to place satellites in orbit.  During the last Space Shuttle mission, I was able to see it pass overhead while docked to the ISS.  Of course, it was just a pinpoint of light, but it was very cool to know that the little dot of light was housing a group of people.\r\n  \r\n  The couple of hours after sunset and before sunrise are the best times to see satellites, since the satellite will still be illuminated by the sun -- most are 500-1500km above the Earth.  NASA has a tool called <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/Realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3d.html\">J-Track 3D</a> that helps you visualize just how much is up there, and how far away it is.\r\n  \r\n  So if you're looking for something to do on these warm summer nights, what could be better than gazing at stars watching for some of man's greatest work to silently slide by overhead.\r\n  \r\n  At the moment, these are the satellites I've seen over the last week:\r\n  <ul class=\"satlist\">\r\n  <li>2009/04/20 21:13 - <a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?SatID=19120\">Cosmos 1943 Rocket</a></li>\r\n  <li>2009/04/19 20:46 - <a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?SatID=14373\">Cosmos 1500 Rocket</a></li>\r\n  <li>2009/04/18 21:51 - <a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?SatID=19120\">Cosmos 1943 Rocket</a></li>\r\n  <li>2009/04/18 21:39 - <a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?SatID=25400\">Resurs 1-4 Rocket</a></li>\r\n  <li>2009/04/15 20:17 - <a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?SatID=28646\">Lacrosse 5</a></li>\r\n  <li>2009/04/14 21:12 - <a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?SatID=25400\">Resurs 1-4</a></li>\r\n  <li>2009/04/14 21:09 - <a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?SatID=28646\">Lacrosse 5</a></li>\r\n  <li>2009/04/14 20:43 - <a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?SatID=25063\">TRMM</a></li>\r\n  <li>2009/04/13 20:53 - <a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?SatID=25063\">TRMM</a></li>\r\n  <li>2009/04/12 22:14 - <a href=\"http://heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?SatID=29499\">MetOp-A</a></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n\n:title: Satspotting\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  I went for a big hike today.  I've been up Mission Peak a bunch of times, and I've always been curious about the the transmission antennas on the peaks to the south.  In looking at the map, I knew that the peaks had names -- Mt. Allison and Monument Peak.  Mt. Allison is 200 feet higher than Mission Peak.  From the Google Maps satellite view, I could see that there were trails on these other peaks.  So I set out to make a route.\r\n  \r\n  This morning, I parked at Ed R. Levin County Park in Milpitas and started up the Agua Caliente trail.  From there I took the Monument Peak trail.  Along the way I saw a few people having a great time hang gliding.  There were lots of cows on this trail, and they were less inclined to moooooove away than the cows I'm used to.\r\n  \r\n  Monument Peak was about 3.5 miles from the parking lot.  At the top were a bunch of microwave transmitters and a HUGE TV transmitter -- about 600 feet tall.\r\n  \r\n  It's a pretty quick hike over to Mt. Allison.  Again, microwaves and a couple big TV transmission structures and assorted equipment.  What really struck me about this place was that there were street signs and addresses, in what seemed to me to be a very remote area.\r\n  \r\n  From Mt. Allison, it was about a 20 minute hike up to the top of Mission Peak.  From that angle, Mission Peak looked AWESOME!   So peaky.  \r\n  \r\n  Only when I started up the incline to the Peak here did I encounter another person.  For the 3 hours prior, I didn't walk past anybody!  There were probably 25 people at the top of Mission Peak.\r\n  \r\n  I sped down the peak, getting to the Ohlone parking lot in about 45 minutes.  I called Arti, and let her know that I had \"landed\".  I walked up Mission Boulevard, got some frozen yogurt (so good after a long hike!) and walked down to the Park &amp; Ride lot next to the McDonald's at 680.  \r\n  \r\n  Total distance was 10.8 miles.  I would totally do it again.  Maybe this time the other way.\r\n  \r\n  <div class=\"dipity_embed\" style=\"width:640px\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.dipity.com/zs/Peak-Trifecta/embed_tl?\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC;\"></iframe><p style=\"margin:0;font-family:Arial,sans;font-size:13px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.dipity.com/zs/Peak-Trifecta\">Peak Trifecta</a> on <a href=\"http://www.dipity.com/\" />Dipity</a>.</p></div>\r\n  \r\n  Here's a map with photos that I took along the route...\r\n  \r\n  <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;t=p&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101677505428675869574.00048257356f51ac2e4f7&amp;ll=37.460995,-121.863956&amp;spn=0.016351,0.027466&amp;z=15&amp;output=embed\"></iframe><br /><small>View <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;t=p&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101677505428675869574.00048257356f51ac2e4f7&amp;ll=37.460995,-121.863956&amp;spn=0.016351,0.027466&amp;z=15&amp;source=embed\" style=\"color:#0000FF;text-align:left\">Peak Trifecta</a> in a larger map</small>\n:title: Peak Trifecta\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

Going from the Stanford Ave parking lot up the Peak Trail is just under 3 miles and the elevation gain is just over 2,000 feet.  My goal was to do this in an hour, but I finished it in 1:04:20 without cutting any swithbacks or taking other shortcuts.  Close enough where next time I think I can do it.\r\n  \r\n  I came down the south side of the peak and crossed over at Hidden Valley back to the Peak Trail.

  data: "--- \n:excerpt: \"\"\n:title: Finally, No Blisters!\n:content: |-\n  I gave my Asolo TPS 520 a lot of chances to do well.  Great reviews on Zappos, designed in the Italian Alps, how could they not be awesome?  Well after 50 miles and sore, blistered feet I knew how.\r\n  \r\n  Zappos let me return them for a full refund, even though they were in very much less than new condition.\r\n  \r\n  My resolution was to find a great hiking shoe that was waterproof, could handle going \"off trail\" and that was, more than anything, comfortable.\r\n  \r\n  I work in Palo Alto on California Avenue.  The best coffee in Palo alto is just down the street from my office and is made by Don Lundell, the co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.zombierunner.com/about/palo_alto_store/\">Zombie Runner</a>.  Apparently, they also are crazy for carrying the best possible equipment for people who run and hike.\r\n  \r\n  I ended up with a pair of Salomon XA Pro 3D Mid GTX boots from there.  From the moment I tried them on, I knew they were it.  Exceptionally friendly and knowledgable sales staff.  Thumbs up for Zombie Runner!\r\n  \r\n  Anyhow, I took a walk in them this past weekend.  Fantastic!  8 miles and hardly a pain from my poor toes.  Off trail, up slippery grass, over rocks -- perfect.  Here is a map of a portion of my route.  The app I use to record the walks went haywire halfway through and didn't capture my route back, which was on the Agua Caliente trail -- the first time I'd taken it.\r\n  \r\n  <object width=\"600\" height=\"500\" codebase=\"http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.everytrail.com/swf/widget.swf\"/><param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"units=english&mode=0&key=ABQIAAAA_7wvFEi7gGngCZrOfos63hSN1xyBy-BzBD--25ZLXpVi3GfbehTQlZCXdpUFII2A5CGeExVTCyX1ow&tripId=863433&startLat=37.457578&startLon=-121.862724&mapType=Terrain&\"><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://www.everytrail.com/swf/widget.swf\" quality=\"high\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\" FlashVars=\"units=english&mode=0&key=ABQIAAAA_7wvFEi7gGngCZrOfos63hSN1xyBy-BzBD--25ZLXpVi3GfbehTQlZCXdpUFII2A5CGeExVTCyX1ow&tripId=863433&startLat=37.457578&startLon=-121.862724&mapType=Terrain&\" play=\"true\"  quality=\"high\"  pluginspage=\"http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer\"></embed></object><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.everytrail.com/trip/widgetimpression?trip_id=863433\"></script>\n"

A nice mix of on- and off-trail hiking.\n:photos: \n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5210609382_b84c0b80d0_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_1991\n  :id: \"5210609382\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5122/5210012911_88d2317fd2_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_1992\n  :id: \"5210012911\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5163/5210609820_c0399523cb_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_1994\n  :id: \"5210609820\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5003/5210609988_ebf15bb3fe_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_1996\n  :id: \"5210609988\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5008/5210013455_e6d468a69a_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2001\n  :id: \"5210013455\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5283/5210013605_9b0f9ab653_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2004\n  :id: \"5210013605\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5005/5210013805_3d90c91fc7_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2005\n  :id: \"5210013805\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4090/5210013983_2e957c9ce1_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2008\n  :id: \"5210013983\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5170/5210610926_d17c76b17d_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2009\n  :id: \"5210610926\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5169/5210014511_c54d8d1338_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2012\n  :id: \"5210014511\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4151/5210014741_8d7f70aa9a_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2013\n  :id: \"5210014741\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5090/5210611526_695620c8d0_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2016\n  :id: \"5210611526\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/5210015181_029e450c69_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2020\n  :id: \"5210015181\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5209/5210015391_e96f7ab383_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2022\n  :id: \"5210015391\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/5210015575_17368f1885_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2025\n  :id: \"5210015575\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4147/5210015789_07225b68ec_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2026\n  :id: \"5210015789\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5210612554_5ab6004303_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2031\n  :id: \"5210612554\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4148/5210612746_81cb8ca66b_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2043\n  :id: \"5210612746\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/5210612958_e9c23abd92_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2045\n  :id: \"5210612958\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4090/5210016673_d1ab774088_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2049\n  :id: \"5210016673\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5162/5210613402_31e53a5778_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2051\n  :id: \"5210613402\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4090/5210017099_7d324440a3_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2052\n  :id: \"5210017099\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4103/5210017315_182fa143b0_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2055\n  :id: \"5210017315\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/5210017483_a23dbc74aa_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2056\n  :id: \"5210017483\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5210614282_92ebebc86f_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2058\n  :id: \"5210614282\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/5210614506_d0d2decc56_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2063\n  :id: \"5210614506\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/5210018165_469252f47d_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2065\n  :id: \"5210018165\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5210018509_b11c6b06a6_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2066\n  :id: \"5210018509\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5210615542_149b508489_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2067\n  :id: \"5210615542\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5003/5210615838_cfef02d1aa_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2068\n  :id: \"5210615838\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5126/5210019503_609f92334f_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2069\n  :id: \"5210019503\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/5210019729_4545a11fd3_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2070\n  :id: \"5210019729\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5210616564_20711f6151_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2071\n  :id: \"5210616564\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5204/5210616772_81af60f3c5_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2072\n  :id: \"5210616772\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/5210617018_7b0b803151_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2073\n  :id: \"5210617018\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5170/5210617240_af9f07bc31_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2074\n  :id: \"5210617240\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5043/5210617446_6492f9f219_s.jpg\n  :title: IMG_2075\n  :id: \"5210617446\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4108/5212420658_af2ae37331_s.jpg\n  :title: Route to Sunol Peak\n  :id: \"5212420658\"\n:primary_photo_id: \"5210609382\"\n:title: 20101126 Sunol Peak\n:id: \"72157625475402074\"\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5210609382_b84c0b80d0_m.jpg\n"

  data: "--- \n:title: Google Apps Authentication for Internal Company Sites\n:excerpt: \"\"\n:content: |\n  Recently I was challenged by my company's CEO to make accessing internal sites\r\n  as easy as accessing our email.\r\n  \r\n  He needed to get to an internal app from the road.  He didn't have a computer\r\n  that was blessed with a VPN configuration, and he's not the type to be excited\r\n  about setting up SSH tunnels.\r\n  \r\n  We use Google Apps for email, calendaring, document sharing, and documentation.\r\n  We can access any of these services from any computer in the world, as long as\r\n  we have our company domain login and password.  Google seems to do a very good\r\n  job of protecting this extremely sensitive information.\r\n  \r\n  When the CEO threw down the access gauntlet, at first I was obstinate.  \"But\r\n  this is _really_ sensitive information you're trying to access!  It needs to be\r\n  encrypted.  It needs to be logged.  Access to an employee needs to be taken\r\n  away when the employee leaves the company.\"\r\n  \r\n  OK deep breath ... then a revelation... Our email has all the necessary\r\n  protections.  Google does one of the best jobs of dealing with security issues\r\n  around login (bot detection, account lockout, password recovery).  The only\r\n  thing our tool was lacking was the encryption, but I know that I can use Apache\r\n  as a reverse proxy to add that.\r\n  \r\n  Google supports several authentication mechanisms including OpenID and OAuth.\r\n  Normally I would shy away from OpenID as a solution due to its strange\r\n  identification scheme (your identity is a URL -- huh?), but as you will see\r\n  there are some clever workarounds if you are securing a single Google Apps\r\n  domain.\r\n  \r\n  This whole thing is made super easy due to the hard work of everyone who\r\n  contributed to <a href=\"http://kin.klever.net/libopkele/\">libopkele</a> and\r\n  <a href=\"http://findingscience.com/mod_auth_openid/\">mod_auth_openid</a>.\r\n  Thank you!\r\n  \r\n  <style>\r\n    code {\r\n      display: block;\r\n      white-space: pre;\r\n      background:#eee;\r\n      border:1px solid #ccc;\r\n      padding:10px;\r\n      overflow-x: auto;\r\n    }\r\n    ul.steps li {\r\n      margin-bottom:20px;\r\n    }\r\n  </style>\r\n  \r\n  <ul class=\"steps\">\r\n    <li>\r\n      Step 1: Install apache, php, mod_ssl, and some other dependencies ...

There are a few examples out there, but here is what I put together to make a very seamless experience for my company's users:\r\n      <code>&lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n      &lt;title&gt;Google Auto-Login Page&lt;/title&gt;\r\n      &lt;style&gt;\r\n        body { font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }\r\n      &lt;/style&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n      &lt;h1&gt;Google Auth Bouncer&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n      &lt;form id=\"openid_form\" action=\"&lt;?php echo $_REQUEST['modauthopenid_referrer'];?&gt;\" method=\"GET\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"openid_identifier\" value=\"http://<b>yourdomain.com</b>/xrds\"/&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"openid.ns.ext1\" value=\"http://openid.net/srv/ax/1.0\" /&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"openid.ext1.mode\" value=\"fetch_request\" /&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"openid.ext1.type.email\" value=\"http://axschema.org/contact/email\" /&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"openid.ext1.required\" value=\"email\" /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/form&gt;\r\n      &lt;script&gt;\r\n        function submit_form() {\r\n  	document.getElementById(\"openid_form\").submit();\r\n        }\r\n      &lt;/script&gt;\r\n      &lt;?php if ($_REQUEST['modauthopenid_error'] != \"\") { ?&gt;\r\n        &lt;font style=\"color: red;\"&gt;There was an error:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;?php echo $_REQUEST['modauthopenid_error']; ?&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  \r\n        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=\"button\" value=\"Try Again...\" onClick=\"submit_form();\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n        Here are the error definitions:\r\n          &lt;ul&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no_idp_found&lt;/strong&gt;:  This is returned when the there was no identity provider URL found on the identity page given by the user, or if the page could not be downloaded.  The user probably just mistyped her identity URL.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;invalid_id_url&lt;/strong&gt;: This is returned when the identity URL given is not syntactically valid.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;idp_not_trusted&lt;/strong&gt;: This is returned when the identity provider of the user is not trusted.  This will only occur if you have at least one of &lt;strong&gt;AuthOpenIDTrusted&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;AuthOpenIDDistrusted&lt;/strong&gt; set.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;invalid_nonce&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a security error.  It generally means that someone is attempting a replay attack, though more innocuous reasons are possible (such as a user who doesn't have cookies enabled refreshing the page).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;canceled&lt;/strong&gt;: This is returned if a user cancels the authentication process.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;unspecified&lt;/strong&gt;: This error can occur for a number of reasons, such a bad signature of the query parameters returned from a user's identity provider.  Most likely, the user should simply be instructed to attempt again.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n      &lt;?php } else { ?&gt;\r\n        Automatically sending you to Google...\r\n        &lt;script&gt;\r\n          submit_form();\r\n        &lt;/script&gt;\r\n      &lt;?php } ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;</code>\r\n    The page auto-submits the form when it is loaded, so there is actually nothing for the user to do!  The trick is to make openid_identifier a hardcoded hidden field that points at a file on your domain.\r\n  \r\n     The form includes parameters to request the user's email address. Google will\r\n     pass it back in a query string param. A more sophisticated implementation\r\n     may make use of that address to pass along to the internal app you're\r\n     protecting.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      Step 5: Configure Apache to use OpenID auth for this host.  The following\r\n      snippet is inside of a VirtualHost block on my server.  You can use it just\r\n      like you would use Basic auth.\r\n    <code>&lt;Location /&gt;\r\n    AuthType OpenID\r\n    Require valid-user\r\n    AuthOpenIDLoginPage /openid.php\r\n    AuthOpenIDTrusted   ^https://www.google.com/a/<b>yourdomain.com</b>/o8/ud$\r\n    AuthOpenIDCookiePath /\r\n    AuthOpenIdCookieLifetime 21600\r\n  &lt;/Location&gt;\r\n  &lt;Files openid.php&gt;\r\n    Allow from all\r\n    Satisfy any\r\n  &lt;/Files&gt;</code>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      Step 6: Restart Apache and make a request to the default virtual host.  You\r\n      should briefly see the openid.php page informing you that it's going to\r\n      send you to Google.  You'll be redirected to a Google Apps\r\n      login/authorization page.  After logging in and granting access to your\r\n      app, you'll be redirected back to the URL you had originally requested.\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n\n"

  data: "--- \n:title: Selectively Disable Session Cookies in Rails 2.3\n:excerpt: \"\"\n:content: |-\n  In doing a project at work to more fully utilize our content delivery network (CDN) and nginx to cache static content, we ran up on a cookie problem in Rails.\r\n  \r\n  We didn't want any cookies returned to requestors in the case where the content would be marked cachable since cookies may contain personal info or provide access to personal info.  My first attempt was to write an around_filter that iterated across the headers hash and unset anything matching my criteria -- in this case, Set-Cookie or some special X- headers we use. \r\n  \r\n  The problem was that the Rails session cookie was still getting set.  I tried and tried a million different things that either were deprecated (e.g. session :off) or some other kind of hackery.\r\n  \r\n  I took a more disciplined approach today to tracing where that cookie was set.  The culprit is the call() method in actionpack/lib/action_controller/session/abstract_store.rb.  In looking at the decision logic on whether to set a cookie, I had a few ideas of how to get around this.\r\n  \r\n  <code>actionpack/lib/action_controller/session/abstract_store.rb:127\r\n  \r\n  def call(env)\r\n  ...\r\n             if !session_data.is_a?(AbstractStore::SessionHash) || session_data.send(:loaded?) || options[:expire_after]\r\n  ...</code>\r\n  \r\n  This led me down the path of resetting the session data to an AbstractStore::SessionHash.  Just doing that wasn't enough.  I had to also set a fake session_options value.  I'm not sure why that is, but I'll figure it out soon.\r\n  \r\n  Here is the final around_filter to hide any special headers and to suppress the Rails session cookie:\r\n  \r\n  <code>  def sanitize_response_headers_if_caching\r\n      yield\r\n      # check for caching\r\n      if (headers[\"Cache-Control\"].to_s.match(/max-age=\\d+, public/))\r\n        headers.keys.each do |header_name|\r\n          if (header_name == \"Set-Cookie\" || header_name.match(/X-[^-]+-COOKIE/))\r\n            headers.delete(header_name)\r\n          end\r\n        end\r\n        # nuke the session -- this call makes it so that the session cookie is not set\r\n        <b>request.session_options = { :session_key => 'foo' } # seemingly unnecessary, but absolutely necessary\r\n        request.session = ActionController::Session::AbstractStore::SessionHash.new({},{})</b>\r\n      end\r\n      true\r\n    end</code>\r\n  \r\n  With this, we can turn on output caching in nginx to help offload work from our application servers in the case of a CDN cache miss.  Those misses are more frequent than one would think, since each edge server in the CDN keeps its own cache.\n"

  data: "--- \n:title: Year of the Loser\n:excerpt: \"\"\n:content: |-\n  I started 2010 with a fat realization that I was too heavy!  It happened one cold December day at a playground with Marina.  She was getting really good on the monkey bars -- and I thought I could show her a couple things.  As soon as I grabbed the bar and my feet left the pavement I realized that I was not prepared to haul quite this much weight around.  I could barely hold on to the bar!\r\n  \r\n  Part two of the realization came when I saw after getting out of the shower that I was carrying a spare tire around my midsection.  I thought I was a thin person, but the weight had crept up on me.\r\n  \r\n  This wasn't all a shock since I'd occasionally step on our bathroom scale in the morning.  I had gotten used to my weight hovering around 205-210.  One day I looked at one of those height-weight charts and was shocked to see that I was square in the \"overweight\" category.  My mental image of myself had always been that I was skinny -- but people tend to not see themselves accurately.  But it was true -- I was overweight.  Things had to change!\r\n  \r\n  Here's what I did:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li><b>I stopped eating until I could not possibly eat any more.</b>  A single portion was actually enough, and I felt better after a meal not having stuffed myself to capacity.</li>\r\n  <li><b>I stopped drinking fruit juice.</b> We would usually mix fruit juice with carbonated water.  It's tasty, but fruit juice is not really that good for you.  Better to eat an apple or orange.</li>\r\n  <li><b>I found a strenuous exercise that I enjoyed.</b> I found in January that I really loved hiking up to the top of things.  It's a great cardio workout on the way up and a strength workout on the way down.  The beautiful scenery, interesting wildlife, and quiet time alone are all big rewards.  I'd get out for a hike every week or two for 3-5 hours at a time.</li>\r\n  <li><b>I was just more mindful of what I was eating overall.</b> Salad instead of french fries, water instead of soda.  Avoiding foods with ingredients I don't recognize as food (a.k.a. not \"engineered\" but rather \"prepared\").</li>\r\n  <li><b>I also got serious about vegetarianism.</b>  There are many reasons why I don't eat meat, but in terms of weight loss it makes me think just a little more about what is going in my mouth.  I know this extra focus on what I'm consuming has kept me eating just a bit more healthy and real than before.</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  \r\n  My first goal was to get down to 200 lbs.  This happened after about 6 weeks.  190 came in another couple of months, then I stabilized at 180 in around June.  I've been that weight since then, with a little blip around the Christmas holiday.  \r\n  \r\n  Given my height and metabolism, I know it was relatively easy for me to shed the pounds.  But I do know that what made the biggest difference was that I changed my habits in subtle but effective ways, rather than going on some crazy crash diet.  I feel better than I've felt in 10 years or more, and can chase the girls around and not feel all jiggly and tired.\n"

  data: "--- \n:title: Alternative Single Table Inheritance for Rails\n:excerpt: Nearly as simple to implement as Rails built-in single table inheritance pattern, but infinitely flexible.\n:content: |-\n  A case came up in doing a revamp on this site's software where I wanted to use one table to store metadata for \"entries\" (blog posts, flickr photo sets, tweets, etc) but wanted a more specialized class to be constructed when reading or writing records to this table to correspond with the particular source type.\r\n  \r\n  Rails provides a simple single-table inheritance capability by using a column called \"type\".  When a record is read in, the value of the type column is used to instantiate an object of that type.  Very simple, and it works in a lot of cases.\r\n  \r\n  If you need more complex logic to determine which class to instantiate or if you don't want to have your database value mirror your class name, then the solution is still fairly simple.\r\n  \r\n  In this case, I had a class called \"Entry\":\r\n  <code>class Entry < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    ...\r\n  end</code>\r\n  \r\n  I wanted to derive a number of classes from Entry to represent specific types of entries...\r\n  <code>class EntryTwitter &lt; Entry\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n  \r\n  class EntryFlickr &lt; Entry\r\n    ...\r\n  end</code>\r\n  \r\n  Step One: Define a method in your base class that uses the method \"becomes()\"...\r\n  <code>class Entry &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    ...\r\n    <strong>def specialized_class\r\n      <span style=\"color:green;\"># e.g. if self.source == \"twitter\" then this will return a \r\n      # class of type EntryTwitter with the same attributes \r\n      # set as the original Entry object</span>\r\n      entry_class = \"entry_#{self.source}\".camelize.constantize\r\n      self.becomes(entry_class)\r\n    end</strong>\r\n  end\r\n  </code>\r\n  \r\n  You can test this by going into script/console and calling the #specialized_class method on your ActiveRecord object...\r\n  <code>&gt;script/console\r\n  Loading development environment (Rails 2.2.2)\r\n  &gt;&gt; Entry.last\r\n  =&gt; #&lt;<strong>Entry</strong> id: 474, source: \"twitter\", ...&gt;\r\n  &gt;&gt; Entry.last.<strong>specialized_class</strong>\r\n  =&gt; #&lt;<strong>EntryTwitter</strong> id: 474, source: \"twitter\", ...&gt;\r\n  &gt;&gt;</code>\r\n  \r\n  Now the last thing to do is to have ActiveRecord always call this method when it instantiates a class from a database record.  The Base#instantiate method is the perfect place for this...\r\n  <code>class Entry &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    ...\r\n    def specialized_class\r\n      entry_class = \"entry_#{self.source}\".camelize.constantize\r\n      self.becomes(entry_class)\r\n    end\r\n  \r\n    <strong>def self.instantiate(record)\r\n      super(record).specialized_class\r\n    end</strong>\r\n  end</code>\r\n  \r\n  Now when you load any object from your table, it will be magically instantiated as the specialized class...\r\n  <code>&gt;script/console\r\n  Loading development environment (Rails 2.2.2)\r\n  &gt;&gt; Entry.last\r\n  =&gt; #&lt;<strong>EntryTwitter</strong> id: 474, source: \"twitter\", ...&gt;\r\n  &gt;&gt;</code>\n"

  data: "--- \n:title: Protect Your Git Repo With a Test Hook\n:content: |-\n  We have a situation at work where we're using a git repository as a data source.  The quality/correctness of the files checked in to this repo is critical to the operation of a larger and very important system.\r\n  \r\n  To help ward off mistakes, we built a series of unit tests using Test::Unit::TestCase, and hooked it into our Rakefile so that before committing a change we (usually) run \"rake test\" and let the automated tests do their thing.  It's so cool that it can do over 1000 checks in a small fraction of a second.  As we identify other pitfalls, we can avoid them in the future by adding new tests.\r\n  \r\n  As long as people run \"rake test\" before pushing their code to the central repository, everything is fine.  But people are not consistent like computers...\r\n  \r\n  Since the correctness of the data in this repo is so important, we put a small script on our git server that prevents commits that do not pass the tests from being \"received\" by the server.  The script is in {repodir}/hooks/pre-receive, and it looks something like this:\r\n  \r\n  <code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby\r\n  # hooks/pre-receive - Git hook for verifying repo data\r\n  \r\n  require \"logger\"\r\n  require \"tempfile\"\r\n  require \"fileutils\"\r\n  \r\n  ME = File.basename $0\r\n  GIT = \"/usr/bin/git\"\r\n  RAKE = \"/usr/bin/rake\"\r\n  TAR = \"/bin/tar\"\r\n  LOGFILE = \"/var/tmp/myrepo-pre-receive.log\"\r\n  TMPDIR = \"/tmp/caches/myrepo.#{$$}\"\r\n  \r\n  $Log = Logger.new(LOGFILE)\r\n  $Log.level = Logger::DEBUG\r\n  $Log.info \"#{ME} start\"\r\n  \r\n  # renders Process::Status object p as a human-readable\r\n  # string, like \"was terminated by signal 1 with status 1 (core dump)\".\r\n  # Returns a message for $? if no Process::Status is passed in.\r\n  def proc_status(p = $?)\r\n    [\r\n      p.exited? ? 'exited' : 'was terminated',\r\n      p.termsig ? \"by signal #{p.termsig}\" : nil,\r\n      'with status', p.exitstatus,\r\n      p.coredump? ? '(core dumped)' : nil\r\n    ].compact.join ' '\r\n  end\r\n  \r\n  # Read stdin to determine what files changed. The input format is:\r\n  # http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html#pre-receive\r\n  \r\n  last_rev = nil\r\n  STDIN.each do |s|\r\n    old, new, ref = s.chomp.split\r\n    $Log.debug \"read from stdin: old = '#{old}', new = '#{new}', ref = '#{ref}'\"\r\n    last_rev = new\r\n  end\r\n  \r\n  # now extract the repo and run tests\r\n  $Log.debug \"exporting repo to #{TMPDIR}\"\r\n  FileUtils.mkdir_p(TMPDIR)\r\n  `#{GIT} archive #{last_rev} | #{TAR} -x -C #{TMPDIR}`\r\n  \r\n  $Log.debug \"running 'rake test' in #{TMPDIR}\"\r\n  puts `cd #{TMPDIR} && #{RAKE} test`\r\n  ps = $?\r\n  \r\n  $Log.debug \"cleaning up #{TMPDIR}\"\r\n  FileUtils.rm_rf(TMPDIR)\r\n  \r\n  $Log.info proc_status(ps)\r\n  \r\n  if ps.to_i > 0\r\n    abort \"Tests failed.  Run 'rake test' locally before pushing.\"\r\n  end\r\n  \r\n  $Log.info \"#{ME} exit\"\r\n  exit 0</code>\r\n  \r\n  Now it is impossible for a change that does not pass the tests to go out.  Another nice feature of this system is that the tests are part of the code in the repo, so nothing else needs to change on the git server side when we change our tests.\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:title: Clipper / Caltrain Frustrations\n:excerpt: \"\"\n:content: |-\n  Below is a letter I sent to Clipper's customer service and Caltrain's Board of Directors...\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  To whom it may concern -\r\n  \r\n  I have called 6 times and spent more than three hours on the phone\r\n  this month with Clipper customer service trying to resolve an issue\r\n  with my auto-loaded Caltrain monthly pass.\r\n  \r\n  These conversations have exposed some things that I feel need to be\r\n  addressed in Clipper and its customer service agents.  Please bear\r\n  with my story below to understand my suggestions:\r\n  \r\n  1) This all started when I realized I forgot to tag off at my\r\n  destination station on the the first workday of the month (Monday\r\n  5/2).  I tried to tag in the afternoon, but that was rejected.\r\n  Apparently there is a maximum time window between tagging on and off\r\n  that is enforced.  This restriction prevented me from \"fixing\" my\r\n  mistake on my own.\r\n  SUGGESTION: increase the tag on/off time window.\r\n  \r\n  2) I phoned Clipper customer service immediately to try to resolve the\r\n  situation.  The woman I talked with told me that this \"happens all the\r\n  time\" and that she would take care of it that day.  Fantastic!  I\r\n  asked her several times if I needed to do anything more, and she\r\n  assured me that I did not.  I was away on business travel for the rest\r\n  of the week, but the following Monday morning (Monday 5/9) I seeked\r\n  out a Caltrain conductor to check the status of my card.  It still had\r\n  a negative balance and he told me that I needed to buy a paper ticket\r\n  or he would write me a $250 citation.  I purchased the paper ticket (I\r\n  have to get to work after all) and phoned Clipper customer service\r\n  again.  The agent informed me that the first agent was incorrect in\r\n  advising me that I didn't need to tag on/off that morning, and that I\r\n  needed to tag on/off the next day and everything would be fine.  The\r\n  conductor on the train should have known this policy and advised me to\r\n  tag on/off instead of purchasing a paper ticket.\r\n  SUGGESTION: ensure all customer service agents and Caltrain conductors\r\n  are experts at the Clipper policies.\r\n  \r\n  3) The following day (Tuesday 5/10) I tagged on/off and a regular\r\n  one-way fare was deducted from my balance, not the monthly pass that I\r\n  was expecting.  Another call to Clipper customer service yielded\r\n  information that the \"autoload message errored out\" (I do not know\r\n  what this means) and that she would put in a request to have another\r\n  autoload message sent through the system.  She also advised me to\r\n  phone back later that day so that she could put in a request for the\r\n  one-way fare to be refunded, since the \"tags\" do not make it back to\r\n  the central database more than a few times a day.  Ok, thank you very\r\n  much -- 30 minutes for that call, and 30 minutes for the followup call\r\n  later in the afternoon to get my money back.\r\n  SUGGESTION: decrease the time between tagging events and customer\r\n  service agents being able to see those events.\r\n  \r\n  4) This morning (Wednesday 5/11) I tagged on/off and again a regular\r\n  one-way fare was deducted.  ANOTHER call to Clipper customer service\r\n  to try to get to the bottom of this.  After giving up on one unhelpful\r\n  agent, I called back again and spoke with someone more helpful who\r\n  informed me that starting on the 10th of the month, monthly passes\r\n  would NEVER be able to be initialized.  The previous two agents\r\n  apparently did not know this part of the lengthy Clipper policy book,\r\n  and thus this explains why the autoload was failing the past two days.\r\n   She advised me that the best course of action at this point is to\r\n  purchase 8 ride tickets for the remainder of the month.  This is very\r\n  inconvenient for me.\r\n  SUGGESTION: ensure all customer service agents are experts at the\r\n  Clipper policies.\r\n  \r\n  I am VERY FRUSTRATED at this point.  I have spent over three hours on\r\n  the phone with customer service agents who do not know the Clipper\r\n  policies, and have led me astray multiple times with bad information.\r\n  I wish I could \"take my business elsewhere\" but there are really no\r\n  other options.\r\n  \r\n  Yes, had I tagged off on that first day there would not have been a\r\n  problem.  A well designed system allows for easy recovery from\r\n  mistakes.  Clipper does not fit this criteria.  Clipper's policies and\r\n  agents make mistakes costly and expensive for riders.  Clipper is a\r\n  very poorly designed system.\r\n  \r\n  Please please please take my suggestions to heart.  With a better\r\n  system, Caltrain should see increased ridership through increased\r\n  rider satisfaction.  I think an electronic card is a good direction,\r\n  but it is implemented so poorly at this point it's net value is\r\n  questionable.\r\n  \r\n  Sincerely,\r\n  Zack Steinkamp\n"

  data: "--- \n:title: Why I'm a Car Control Instructor\n:excerpt: \"\"\n:content: |-\n  Almost seven years ago I did my first BMWCCA Car Control Clinic as a student.  The CCC is an all-day high performance driving school, with a focus on real-world skills.  It's also a prerequisite for the club's driving schools held at local racetracks like Laguna Seca or Infineon Raceway.  The CCC is held in a vast expanse of pavement, either in the Candlestick Park parking lot or an unused section of tarmac at the Marina Airport near Monterey.  \r\n  \r\n  The school centers around three exercies:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>An emergency braking and lane-change course</li>\r\n  <li>An oval-shaped skidpad to experiment with the effects of weight transfer on a car's ability to turn</li>\r\n  <li>A slalom course with two slaloms (fast side and slow side) connected with 180 degree turns, like a little racetrack</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  The courses are marked with small orange cones.  Students are divided into three groups, and spend two hours at each exercise during the day.\r\n  \r\n  <img src=\"http://www.ggcbmwcca.org/IMAGES/clinic-photo.jpg\" align=\"right\" style=\"padding-left:10px;\">After my first CCC, I was hooked.  I did the CCC two more times after that, also mixing in a healthy dose of club autocross events and getting more and more into the club's track schools.  I made a lot of friends in the club, and got to know the event organizers and instructors pretty well.\r\n  \r\n  In February 2007 I got The Call from Mister CCC himself, Bob Gobel.  They were looking for some more instructors for an upcoming CCC, and was I interested in trying it out?   Oh yes I was!  I had gotten a new job the month prior, but this was more exciting to me.\r\n  \r\n  The days leading up to that first CCC where I'd be an instructor were nerve racking.  Would I do well?  Would I get carsick?  Would I have anything to offer anyone?  Well, the first day came and went and I had a blast!\r\n  \r\n  Being able to share in someone else's \"lightbulb moment\" with the car or their eyes or hands was all the payment I needed to do this volunteer job.  The time in the morning and at lunch where instructors get to play on the exercises is a nice bonus too to practice my own car control skills.\r\n  \r\n  This past weekend was another CCC -- it may have been my 20th, and I had a new job at this one.  Rather than being a ridealong instructor, I was put in charge of one of the slalom courses.  I was to introduce the exercise to each group of students, teaching them the course layout and the goals of the exercise (vision, planning, smoothness).  My job was also to ensure that it all ran smoothly and safely.  Unfortunately, riding with students in cars was not a big part of this job.  However, I did get a chance to ride with a couple of students.  One in particular stands out for me as the best example of why I love doing this.  \r\n  \r\n  I was chatting a bit with fellow instructor Tristan, a wunderkind of car control.  He is fairly new to the instruction thing and was sharing some frustration with not being able to break a student out of his shell.  See, some students take to the exercises and environment and go gung-ho from the start, squealing tires and pushing their car to its limit and beyond.  On the other side are those who do not embrace the fact that we're in a place where there is nothing to run into.  These folks drive very slowly and carefully, just as they would on the street.  They do not press the gas pedal hard without some serious encouragement.\r\n  \r\n  One of our jobs as instructors is to figure out how and how much to push each person out of their comfort zone, to help them experience something new and different in their car.  We are ecstatic if every student is squealing their tires and spinning out at least once during the day.  For those that give us a nice, comfortable ride ... well, we need to figure out how to fix that.\r\n  \r\n  Tristan asked me if I'd hop into this gentleman's car to see if I could get him and his car to slide around a bit.  Great!  Sure!  He was cool with watching over the exercise, so I got into the guy's car and introduced myself and started giving him a pep talk about how this is a really safe school, and how we need to push everyone to a new place with their driving and things get a LOT funner after you get there once.\r\n  \r\n  It was our turn to go out on the course, so I asked him to show me what he had learned so far.  He was very smooth, impeccably precise, very much in crontrol.  Cool!  But the car's tires were silent.  This was a problem!  \r\n  \r\n  On our second lap I warned him that I was going to start really encouraging him to go faster -- in a big way.  So as we were halfway around the last turn before the \"fast\" slalom side, I told him to punch it.  \"FLOOR IT!  NOW!\"  He complied!  Great!  Off we went into the fast slalom, but then he backed off.  \"go! go! Go! Go! GO! GO! FASTER FASTER NOW!!!!!\"  He got back into it, but then it was time for the next turn.  We went through the slow side of the slalom and I gave him more encouraging words.  \"That was great, let's do that again, but stay in it!\"  \r\n  \r\n  So as we rounded that last turn again, I was literally screaming at him \"PUNCH IT NOW!  HOLD IT DOWN!  GO GO GO GO!!!!! FASTER!  KEEP GOING!!!!  YOU'VE GOT IT\"  We were flying through the fast side and he was keeping up with the car.  \"BRAKES!  BRAKES! HARD!\"  We needed to slow down now to make the turnaround.  I could tell he was feeling the adrenaline at this point.  \r\n  \r\n  \"That's our four laps, but let's do one more ... you've got it now, let's keep going!\".   Again through the last turn, then \"GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO!!!!! KEEP IT UP!!! GREAT!!!!\"  He was feeling it now and doing it on his own.  As we slowed down for the slow side I could tell the adrenaline was out in force in his blood.  I congratulated him on his accomplishment and let him know that it was our last lap.\r\n  \r\n  We exited the course and he did not say a word, but I could see that his hands were shaking on the wheel.  \"So, what do you think about that?\", I asked.\r\n  \r\n  After a long pause, hands trembling and gripping the steering wheel, grinning from ear to ear, all he could muster was a breathless \"WOW!\"\r\n  \r\n  Every student at a CCC has a moment like this.  Some earlier than others, some stronger than others.  But it is that exact moment that makes the day totally worth it -- for everyone.\n"

Umunhum (3500ft) today.  This mountain is known for \\\"The Box\\\" that sits atop it, which used to be the base of a large radar antenna operated by the Air Force from the 50s until the 80s.  There is a project underway to turn this area into a public park, starting with a huge cleanup effort to remove the lead, asbestos, and other nasties from the facility.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  My last attempt to summit Umunhum was thwarted by the thought of hillbillies and methmakers who are rumored to live in the area, as my route took me out of the park and onto private roads.  After some careful planning on an alternate route that stayed 100% in the park land, I got a chance to try it today.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  From Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve, take the Woods Rd trail for 2.7 miles.  Turn left at the Barlow Rd trail and go a mile or so.  Once you get to the \\\"spine\\\" of the mountain, turn right up the hill.  This is very steep and somewhat treacherous, but was a very beautiful part of the hike once I was out of the thick underbrush.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  You can download a .gpx track of the route at http://steinkamp.us/umunhum.gpx\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Update 2011-11-01: I got a mysterious email after posing this.  Check it out below:\\r\\n\\\n  <blockquote style=\\\"padding:1em; border:1px solid #CCC; background:#eee;\\\">\\r\\n\\\n  From: TheBoxOnTheHill theboxonthehill@gmail.com\\r\\n\\\n  <br/>Subject: Illegal Hiking\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Mr. Steinkamp,\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Your hiking on Mt. Umunhum was done illegally and this is to advise you that the appropriate authorities have been notified.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The entire mountain is off limits it o the public and not open to hiking, biking, or any other access for that matter.  You illegally trespassed on \\\"Closed Area\\\" and \\\"Hazardous Area\\\" property which is a misdemeanor citable offense.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  http://www.openspace.org/news/\\r\\n\\\n  http://www.openspace.org/news/downloads/2011.07.22.MtUmClosedAreaMap.pdf\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Next time, READ THE SIGNS.  And don't claim any bullshit about \\\"there were none\\\".  They're there and you know it.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Perhaps we notify your employer as well (as to what you're doing on your \\\"spare time\\\"...  trespassing)\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Remove the photos and your blog post and you might make things easier for you.\\r\\n\\\n  </blockquote>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Vigilante park ranger?

Here's an awesome video made with VHS \"pause button editing\" of that great car...\r\n  \r\n  <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/eMwUxbMOYv4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n  \r\n  In Pop's own words \"I really enjoyed building that car and I think I really nailed it from an appearance standpoint.  I had a lot of fun with it...drove it over 30,000 miles.  I wish I could keep them all, but since I can't I'm glad it sold it which enabled more adventures with some other cars. [...] Easy launch...even with the locker rear end, those little rear tires would just smoke unless I was easy on the gas/clutch until it was rolling.  Power shifting all gears....right foot on the floor, stab the clutch at 6k and slam the next gear.\"\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://s706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Cars-Studebakers/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7824_nosign.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Cars-Studebakers/IMG_7824_nosign.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"S2D\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  Bad-ass.\n"

  data: "--- \n:title: Costa Rica Vacation\n:thumb_url: \"\"\n:content: \"<h3>Sunday</h3>\\r\\n\\\n  Getting to Costa Rica was an adventure in itself.  Out flight to Houston left SFO at 12:30am PT, and arrived at around 6:30am CT.  The flight from Houston to San Jose, CR was scheduled to leave at 10:40am, which left us with four hours to kill in Houston.  We wandered around a bit, dodging to onslaught of electric people-moving carts (anyone who has been to IAH knows what I'm talking about...).  We passed by the United Club in the international terminal.  \\\"I wonder if we could get in there\\\", Arti wondered out loud as we passed by.  In a sleepy daze, we decided to check.  Turns out that since we had bought upgraded tickets (first class was surprisingly only a couple of hundred dollars more) we could get in to this exclusive place.  It was very nice inside - quiet, comfortable chairs, free breakfast, showers, the works.  We slept for a bit, then had some bagels, yogurt, fruit and granola.  We popped out to the Starbucks down the way to get some coffee too.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The flight to San Jose was delayed a bit due to mechanical issues, which made us nervous for our next connection, but it worked out just fine.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After landing in San Jose, we hopped in a cab for a 20 minute ride to a smaller airport where we would take a small plane to the Tambor Airport, located on the Nicoya Peninsula.  Riding in the single turboprop Cessna Caravan was my favorite part of thee journey there.  We sat right behind the pilots on this 15 passenger plane, which was a lot of fun.  It was a very smooth ride, and a thrilling landing, since the tiny airstrip is right on the beach.  Here's a video of the landing...\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/UW6FHj5iVYo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  From Tambor, we rode in a car for about 45 minutes on paved and dirt roads until we got to the town on Santa Teresa and our hotel Flora Blanca.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We were welcomed with a fresh coconut with a straw inserted through a small hole in the top, and warm Costa Rican hospitality.  Fernando got our paperwork sorted out, the took us for a tour of the hotel grounds, the restaurant, yoga room, pool, spa, and our room.  The hotel has 9 villas on 7 beachfront acres.  It's pretty spectacular.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We relaxed in our room for a bit, exhausted after the 20 hours of traveling that started before midnight the day before.  After a bit of cleanup, we ventured out to the hotel restaurant for a late dinner.  The staff was so friendly and accommodated our vegetarianness with aplomb.  Billy the sous chef came out to talk with us about some options that were off the menu, and we ended up with a really delicious and special meal.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Off to bed for 11 hours of sleep (!!!).  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <h3>Monday</h3>\\r\\n\\\n  We got up just before the 11am breakfast cutoff, and had some awesome Gallo Pinto (rice, beans, eggs, fresh fruit, and handmade corn tortillas).  There is this salsa in Costa Rica called Lizano that is so delicious on pretty much anything, and it was well represented here.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We then went back to the room and changed in to our swimming clothes and headed out to the beach for a little sun and water fun.  The water here is just right!  Not so hot that you get hot swimming, and not so cold that it takes any time to get used to.  Very nice.  After a few hours, we went back for lunch, then talked with the hotel concierge about some options for our remaining days here.  Then we spent some time at the pool.   At 4:30, Arti went to get a massage, and I did some exploring north along the coast.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We had dinner at the hotel next door named Milarepa.  It's run by a French couple, and we had a nice salad, gaspacho, veggie risotto, and a delicious banana-filled crepe with a nice chocolate sauce on top.  We walked back to our hotel and got a couple of decaf cappuccinos and walked down to the beach to enjoy them under the amazing canopy of stars.  There are SO many stars visible here.  Really astounding.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <h3>Tuesday</h3>\\r\\n\\\n  We got up at about 6:45am to get ready and be at breakfast at 7am.  Our itinerary for today was a stand-up paddle boarding lesson at 8am, then horseback riding at 2:30pm.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The stand-up paddle boarding was a lot more fun than I expected!  Our teacher was Andy at Freedom SUP in Mal Pais.  He moved to CR from the San Diego area in 1994.  His background is in surfboard design and shaping, and so he also makes surfboards for locals here.  We did a 20 minute \\\"ground school\\\" in the soccer field adjacent to the beach, then in the water we went.  It was pretty easy to pick up, and I only fell in the water a couple or five times.  Toward the end of our hour in the water I was feeling pretty comfortable.  Too bad the wind was pretty strong - we stayed close to the beach rather than traveling around the point to see some of the nature preserve at the southern tip of the peninsula.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After some relaxing, we had lunch, then more relaxing, then a short drive north to where we would ride some horses.  We started on a beach near Playa Hermosa.  Our guide Carlos was excellent, as was our guide-in-training Veronica.  We rode along the beach, then turned inland and rode up and down some amazing hills within a 500 acre cattle ranch.  We saw many kinds of birds and fruit trees.  The horses were super well behaved and would respond to the slightest nudge, but at the same time would smartly choose a good path in the many areas we went through where there was no clear path.  We came to a little bar in the middle of nowhere (a crossroads between a few towns) and stopped for a soda and some time out of the saddle.  Back on the horses for the ride back, mostly on the beach, just in time to watch the sun set. An excellent experience that was better than I had hoped it would be!\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After getting back to the hotel, we cleaned up a bit then walked 500m or so down the road to a little Italian restaurant called Al Chile Viola.  We shared a nice salad, and ordered a potato ravioli dish in butter and sage, as well as a farfale with tomatoes and garlic.  Their pastas are made on site and were excellent.  We finished the meal with a delicious banana brownie ala mode, then walked back to the hotel. \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <h3>Wednesday</h3>\\r\\n\\\n  We got up at 6:30 for an early breakfast so we could be on the way to the Cabo Blanco nature preserve by 7am.  After bagels, fresh fruit, and coffee, we met up with our guy Pablo in the hotel parking lot.  We were to ride an ATV about 40 minutes to Cabo Blanco where we would hike.  He explained how the ATV worked (5sp semi-automatic with reverse!) and we were off!  Riding the ATV was a lot of fun - probably the 2nd best way around Costa Rica's varied terrain.  A motorcycle seems to be the best way to get around.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We arrived at the reserve, paid the $10/person admission to a jolly guy, and we started outlet hike.  Pablo has studied biology and anthropology so he is an excellent resource for plants and animals.  He was very patient with us, and many times led us off the trail to observe interesting trees or animal behavior.  One notable case was when we got to hear the call and see the elaborate competitive mating dance of the Long Tail Manakin (Tol\\xC3\\xA9do).  We also watched a Pale Billed Woodpecker fairly close knock on a tree then peer sideways at it to see if it had scared any worms out.  He is an expert in the local life, and helped us to experience and understand it to the fullest.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  As our four mile walk came to an end, the topic of lunch came up.  Given that we rode through a few small towns, it seemed to me that we could find a great typical Costa Rican \\\"soda\\\" to stop to eat.  Pablo asked us what we wanted to eat, and I told him that some traditional rice, beans, and plantains would hit the spot.  His eyes lit up as the idea came to him to share a place that he was very familiar with to us.  He explained to us that this place has been run by the same woman for decades, has no menu, and the rice and beans taste just like his grandmother would make.  Say no more!  I was sold.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We arrived at the nondescript restaurant and were greeted by la se\\xC3\\xB1ora herself.  Pablo explained what we were in the mood for, and she set off to make us lunch.  She told us about the pickles and salsas she had made this week, and offered some special pickled chiles she had behind the counter.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The meal was better than I had hoped for.  Simple and delicious rice, beans, plantains, and a cabbage and beet slaw that cut it all perfectly.  Her salsas and pickles were the perfect accompaniment.  Not once did I long for a shot of the Costa Rican staple Lizano salsa.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  At the end of this excellent meal, we thanked her as best we could in our meager Spanish, and I asked Pablo to relay the message to her that this was the best meal I have had in Costa Rica.  Her smile gave away that she was quite pleased with this.  She tirned to her friend and said quietly that she was happy that people still liked her food.  With all the foreign immigrants and tourists in the area, traditional Costa Rican cooking is becoming rare.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  With happy bellies, we rode the ATV back to the hotel.  We thanked Pablo, who we would spend Thursday with again on another tour.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After a short rest, we headed down to the beach.  Arti did sim sunny reading and I played in the waves for an hour or so.  We got some cold drinks then cappuccinos back at the hotel bar, then showered and got ready for dinner.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We took a cab to a well known restaurant in the area called Brisas Del Mar.  It's high on a hill overlooking the ocean.  We got there just as the sky started to change color with the sunset.  It was a delicious meal, and we met a very nice couple from Montana who were celebrating their final night in Costa Rica.  We ate as the sun set.  After dinner we walked around that part of town a bit and did some grocery shopping (Lizano, chocolate, and lollipops for the girls) then our taxi picked us up to go back to the hotel.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We talked to Spencer, our hotel's executive chef, about a special dinner for Thursday night.  He was excited to be put on a creative mission, and we're excited about what he will come up with!\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <h3>Thursday</h3>\\r\\n\\\n  Thursday had us up and ready for breakfast at 7am.  After some excellent cappuccinos and food, we again met Pablo at the hotel entrance to begin the day's adventure.  Today we were going to ride the ATVs to a zip line place just outside of Mal Pais.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Zip lines are steel cables strung between trees.  You wear a harness around your legs and waist, with a nylon strap coming up from the middle that attaches to a pulley.  You hook up to the pulley, and let gravity zip you from tree to tree.  You wear heavy leather gloves, and use one hand as a brake on the line.  Without the brake, the ending can be, uh, dramatic.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We arrived at the place in about 20 minutes on the ATVs.  After a quick ground school lesson, we piled into the bed of a pickup and drove up a steep grade to the top of a hill.  We were going to go down 9 zip lines, returning to where we started, zig-zagging through the trees down the hill.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The guys running the place were pros, as was Pablo.  The first time was a little bit scary, since we were to climb up a rickety platform suspended in a tree, and then jump off with a 20-100 foot drop below.  After the first one though, we learned to trust the equipment and the guys that were hooking us up to the pulleys.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Pablo suggested I try the \\\"Superman\\\" on the longest, fastest line.  Of course I complied, not knowing exactly what this was to be.  Normally the strap that connects the harness to the pulley comes up from around your belt buckle area, and you zip down in a position similar to sitting on a chaise lounge.  With the Superman, the attachment strap is moved to the back, so you are suspended face down, and attached to another person who is managing the braking.  I got into position, and one of the guys who works there hooked me up to his pulley.  He showed me my pulley and said \\\"cuarenta [forty] kilometers per hora\\\".  He pointed to his and with a big smile said \\\"<i>setenta</i> [seventy] kilometers per hora\\\".\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  So there I was, standing in front of the zip line master guy with my back to him, my attachment strap hooked to his 70kph pulley, him behind me.  \\\"Give me one leg,\\\" he said, so I raised one leg back.  \\\"Ok, now the other one\\\", now I was suspended, looking down at the treetops below.  The zipline stretches FAR into the distance.  \\\"Ready?\\\"  \\\"Oh yeah...\\\" and then off we went.  HOLY CRAP.  This was amazing.  Really really amazing, FLYING just above the trees SO FAST, hearing the high-pitched whine of the pulley, zipping past branches and through holes between trees, with my arms out like a bird.  I was just screaming like crazy it was such an absolutely terrific experience!!!  The landing platform came into view and I heard and felt the brake come in.  We landed perfectly on the platform.  Huge high-five for the helper, and a huge smile for the rest of the day for me.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We finished out the remaining lines, none more exciting than that one though.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After the zip lines, we hopped on the ATVs and rode to a spot outside of Montezuma to hike to a waterfall.  We parked in an unmarked spot, and walked along a hillside trail to a really magnificent place with water tumbling down rocks, then a 10 foot drop to a tree-lined pool, which then led to a 40 foot drop to another pool, then another 50 foot drop to the final pool.  Pablo had dove off all three, but neither Arti nor I wanted to do more than the 10-footer.  Marina and Naomi need functioning parents more than we need a thrill like that!  We spent some time jumping off the rocks and swimming in the refreshing fresh water.  It was a really beautiful place, complete with a Gold-Billed Heron in a nest just above the 40-foot falls.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We swam as much as we wanted, then hiked back to the ATVs to get some lunch in Montezuma.  Pablo found a place for us that overlooked the ocean, and we had some good Costa Rican <i>Casado</i> (rice/beans plate).\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Back to the hotel, and we parted ways with Pablo for the final time.  He was such an excellent guide and host.  His knowledge of the local culture, plants, animals, and willingness to show folks like us around was very much appreciated.  We exchanged email addresses, and I sincerely hope we cross paths again.  He sped off to prepare for a private dinner he was cooking for that night.  His true passion is gastronomy, and after he gets his Masters degree in Archaeology, he is going to go to culinary school in Italy, hoping to return to Costa Rica to use his skills to make uniquely Costa Rican food using plants that are indigenous to the area.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Thursday afternoon, we sulked around by the pool for a while, sad that our vacation was winding down.  However, we had our special dinner to look forward to.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We got cleaned up in the room, and then went down to the pool/dinner area to see the staff had set up the \\\"dojo\\\" for us to eat in.  This is a covered platform above one side of the pool where there are normally a couple of couches.  This is where we were going to enjoy Spencer and Billy's creations for us.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The meal started with a caprese \\\"shooter\\\", then a salad with lettuce, a bit of basil, and a couple of gorgonzola-stuffed mushrooms to top it off.  The next course was a succotash of asparagus, olives, and other winter veggies in a phenomenal red wine reduction.  The main course was a panko-stuffed tomato along side some tasty veggie orzo.  Dessert was a molten chocolate cake in a ramican with a small scoop of coffee ice cream on the side.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  It was great that the chefs at Flor Blanca would make such a special meal for us.  This is really a great example of the level of service we received all around there. \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <h3>Friday</h3>\\r\\n\\\n  We took a quick final walk on the beach before breakfast Friday.  After we ate, it was time to pack up and be ready for our 9:30a car ride to the airport.  We got to Tambor airport with plenty of time to spare, so we checked in (comprised of stepping on a scale and paying the $2.25 airport tax), and waited for our plane to arrive.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We rode in a Cessna Caravan from Tambor back to San Jose.  We had three hours between those flights, so we took a taxi in to the city center for some souvenir shopping.  We got back to the airport to see that our flight was delayed a bit, which made us a little nervous since we had only an hour in Houston to go through customs, get our bags, and re-check them on the flight to San Francisco.  It ended up not being a problem at all ... we did all that in Houston in less than 30 minutes.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The flight back to San Francisco was delayed about an hour, which combined with arriving at 12:30a PT (2:30a CT) made it feel pretty long.  Driving home from the airport was a big test in stamina, since we had been traveling for the extent of the day.  \\r\\n\"\n:excerpt: A Day-by-day journal of our trip.\n"

Out flight to Houston left SFO at 12:30am PT, and arrived at around 6:30am CT.  The flight from Houston to San Jose, CR was scheduled to leave at 10:40am, which left us with four hours to kill in Houston.  We wandered around a bit, dodging to onslaught of electric people-moving carts (anyone who has been to IAH knows what I'm talking about...).  We passed by the United Club in the international terminal.  \"I wonder if we could get in there\", Arti wondered out loud as we passed by.  In a sleepy daze, we decided to check.  Turns out that since we had bought upgraded tickets (first class was surprisingly only a couple of hundred dollars more) we could get in to this exclusive place.  It was very nice inside - quiet, comfortable chairs, free breakfast, showers, the works.  We slept for a bit, then had some bagels, yogurt, fruit and granola.  We popped out to the Starbucks down the way to get some coffee too.\r\n  \r\n  The flight to San Jose was delayed a bit due to mechanical issues, which made us nervous for our next connection, but it worked out just fine.\r\n  \r\n  After landing in San Jose, we hopped in a cab for a 20 minute ride to a smaller airport where we would take a small plane to the Tambor Airport, located on the Nicoya Peninsula.  Riding in the single turboprop Cessna Caravan was my favorite part of thee journey there.  We sat right behind the pilots on this 15 passenger plane, which was a lot of fun.  It was a very smooth ride, and a thrilling landing, since the tiny airstrip is right on the beach.  Here's a video of the landing...\r\n  \r\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/UW6FHj5iVYo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n  \r\n  From Tambor, we rode in a car for about 45 minutes on paved and dirt roads until we got to the town on Santa Teresa and our hotel Flora Blanca.\r\n  \r\n  We were welcomed with a fresh coconut with a straw inserted through a small hole in the top, and warm Costa Rican hospitality.  Fernando got our paperwork sorted out, the took us for a tour of the hotel grounds, the restaurant, yoga room, pool, spa, and our room.  The hotel has 9 villas on 7 beachfront acres.  It's pretty spectacular.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://360.io/JJx92H\">Click for a panorama from outside our villa</a>.\r\n  And <a href=\"http://360.io/sD6EkT\">here is a panorama of the outdoor bathroom</a> which was more awesome than I imagined.\r\n  \r\n  We relaxed in our room for a bit, exhausted after the 20 hours of traveling that started before midnight the day before.  After a bit of cleanup, we ventured out to the hotel restaurant for a late dinner.  The staff was so friendly and accommodated our vegetarianness with aplomb.  Billy the sous chef came out to talk with us about some options that were off the menu, and we ended up with a really delicious and special meal.\r\n  \r\n  Off to bed for 11 hours of sleep (!!!).  \r\n  \r\n  <h3>Monday</h3>\r\n  We got up just before the 11am breakfast cutoff, and had some awesome Gallo Pinto (rice, beans, eggs, fresh fruit, and handmade corn tortillas).  There is this salsa in Costa Rica called Lizano that is so delicious on pretty much anything, and it was well represented here.\r\n  \r\n  We then went back to the room and changed in to our swimming clothes and headed out to the beach for a little sun and water fun.  The water here is just right!  Not so hot that you get hot swimming, and not so cold that it takes any time to get used to.  Very nice.  After a few hours, we went back for lunch, then talked with the hotel concierge about some options for our remaining days here.  Then we spent some time at the pool.   At 4:30, Arti went to get a massage, and I did some exploring north along the coast.\r\n  \r\n  <iframe width=640 height=480 src=\"http://360.io/43HB4U\"></iframe>\r\n  \r\n  We had dinner at the hotel next door named Milarepa.  It's run by a French couple, and we had a nice salad, gaspacho, veggie risotto, and a delicious banana-filled crepe with a nice chocolate sauce on top.  We walked back to our hotel and got a couple of decaf cappuccinos and walked down to the beach to enjoy them under the amazing canopy of stars.  There are SO many stars visible here.  Really astounding.\n:id: \"72157629462881571\"\n:excerpt: We traveled to Costa Rica beginning at 12:30a PT on Sunday.  We arrived at our hotel that evening, had dinner, then hit the sack.  Monday was a lazy day of playing in the ocean, swimming in the pool, a massage for Arti and some exploring up the coast for me.\n"

Our itinerary for today was a stand-up paddle boarding lesson at 8am, then horseback riding at 2:30pm.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We watched this monkey family go from tree to tree while we were having breakfast:\\r\\n\\\n  <iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/FRYATnAxhjQ\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The stand-up paddle boarding was a lot more fun than I expected!  Our teacher was Andy at Freedom SUP in Mal Pais.  He moved to CR from the San Diego area in 1994.  His background is in surfboard design and shaping, and so he also makes surfboards for locals here.  We did a 20 minute \\\"ground school\\\" in the soccer field adjacent to the beach, then in the water we went.  It was pretty easy to pick up, and I only fell in the water a couple or five times.  Toward the end of our hour in the water I was feeling pretty comfortable.  Too bad the wind was pretty strong - we stayed close to the beach rather than traveling around the point to see some of the nature preserve at the southern tip of the peninsula.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After some relaxing, we had lunch, then more relaxing, then a short drive north to where we would ride some horses.  We started on a beach near Playa Hermosa.  Our guide Pablo was excellent, as was our guide-in-training Veronica.  We rode along the beach, then turned inland and rode up and down some amazing hills within a 500 acre cattle ranch.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lFgtrxxtWc4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/afrzBZCzt9Y\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>(the squeaking was my saddle)\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We saw many kinds of birds and fruit trees.  The horses were super well behaved and would respond to the slightest nudge, but at the same time would smartly choose a good path in the many areas we went through where there was no clear path.  We came to a little bar in the middle of nowhere (a crossroads between a few towns) and stopped for a soda and some time out of the saddle.  Back on the horses for the ride back, mostly on the beach, just in time to watch the sun set. An excellent experience that was better than I had hoped it would be!\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After getting back to the hotel, we cleaned up a bit then walked 500m or so down the road to a little Italian restaurant called Al Chile Viola.  We shared a nice salad, and ordered a potato ravioli dish in butter and sage, as well as a farfale with tomatoes and garlic.  Their pastas are made on site and were excellent.  We finished the meal with a delicious banana brownie ala mode, then walked back to the hotel. \"\n:id: \"72157629462860001\"\n:excerpt: In the morning on Tuesday, we took a stand-up paddleboard lesson (sorry, no photos) and then in the afternoon went horseback riding on the beach and up into the hills on a private ranch.  Dinner was at Al Chile Violet down the street.\n"

After bagels, fresh fruit, and coffee, we met up with our guy Pablo in the hotel parking lot.  We were to ride an ATV about 40 minutes to Cabo Blanco where we would hike.  He explained how the ATV worked (5sp semi-automatic with reverse!) and we were off!  Riding the ATV was a lot of fun - probably the 2nd best way around Costa Rica's varied terrain.  A motorcycle seems to be the best way to get around.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We arrived at the reserve, paid the $10/person admission to a jolly guy, and we started outlet hike.  Pablo has studied biology and anthropology so he is an excellent resource for plants and animals.  He was very patient with us, and many times led us off the trail to observe interesting trees or animal behavior.  One notable case was when we got to hear the call and see the elaborate competitive mating dance of the Long Tail Manakin (Tol\\xC3\\xA9do).  We also watched a Pale Billed Woodpecker fairly close knock on a tree then peer sideways at it to see if it had scared any worms out.  He is an expert in the local life, and helped us to experience and understand it to the fullest.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://360.io/wULCum\\\">Here is a 360-degree panoramas from the walk</a>.  <a href=\\\"http://360.io/PXCumK\\\">And another</a>.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  As our four mile walk came to an end, the topic of lunch came up.  Given that we rode through a few small towns, it seemed to me that we could find a great typical Costa Rican \\\"soda\\\" to stop to eat.  Pablo asked us what we wanted to eat, and I told him that some traditional rice, beans, and plantains would hit the spot.  His eyes lit up as the idea came to him to share a place that he was very familiar with to us.  He explained to us that this place has been run by the same woman for decades, has no menu, and the rice and beans taste just like his grandmother would make.  Say no more!  I was sold.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We arrived at the nondescript restaurant and were greeted by la se\\xC3\\xB1ora herself.  Pablo explained what we were in the mood for, and she set off to make us lunch.  She told us about the pickles and salsas she had made this week, and offered some special pickled chiles she had behind the counter.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The meal was better than I had hoped for.  Simple and delicious rice, beans, plantains, and a cabbage and beet slaw that cut it all perfectly.  Her salsas and pickles were the perfect accompaniment.  Not once did I long for a shot of the Costa Rican staple Lizano salsa.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  At the end of this excellent meal, we thanked her as best we could in our meager Spanish, and I asked Pablo to relay the message to her that this was the best meal I have had in Costa Rica.  Her smile gave away that she was quite pleased with this.  She tirned to her friend and said quietly that she was happy that people still liked her food.  With all the foreign immigrants and tourists in the area, traditional Costa Rican cooking is becoming rare.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  With happy bellies, we rode the ATV back to the hotel.  We thanked Pablo, who we would spend Thursday with again on another tour.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After a short rest, we headed down to the beach.  Arti did sim sunny reading and I played in the waves for an hour or so.  We got some cold drinks then cappuccinos back at the hotel bar, then showered and got ready for dinner.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We took a cab to a well known restaurant in the area called Brisas Del Mar.  It's high on a hill overlooking the ocean.  We got there just as the sky started to change color with the sunset.  It was a delicious meal, and we met a very nice couple from Montana who were celebrating their final night in Costa Rica.  We ate as the sun set.  After dinner we walked around that part of town a bit and did some grocery shopping (Lizano, chocolate, and lollipops for the girls) then our taxi picked us up to go back to the hotel.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We talked to Spencer, our hotel's executive chef, about a special dinner for Thursday night.  He was excited to be put on a creative mission, and we're excited about what he will come up with!\"\n:id: \"72157629098214278\"\n:excerpt: On Wednesday, we rode the ATV to Cabo Blanco Nature Reserve and had a great hike with Pablo along with a memorable lunch.  In the evening we enjoyed the sunset with dinner at Brisas Del Mar.\n"

After some excellent cappuccinos and food, we again met Pablo at the hotel entrance to begin the day's adventure.  Today we were going to ride the ATVs to a zip line place just outside of Mal Pais.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Zip lines are steel cables strung between trees.  You wear a harness around your legs and waist, with a nylon strap coming up from the middle that attaches to a pulley.  You hook up to the pulley, and let gravity zip you from tree to tree.  You wear heavy leather gloves, and use one hand as a brake on the line.  Without the brake, the ending can be, uh, dramatic.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We arrived at the place in about 20 minutes on the ATVs.  After a quick ground school lesson, we piled into the bed of a pickup and drove up a steep grade to the top of a hill.  We were going to go down 9 zip lines, returning to where we started, zig-zagging through the trees down the hill.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The guys running the place were pros, as was Pablo.  The first time was a little bit scary, since we were to climb up a rickety platform suspended in a tree, and then jump off with a 20-100 foot drop below.  After the first one though, we learned to trust the equipment and the guys that were hooking us up to the pulleys.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  A video of Arti taking off on a zip line:\\r\\n\\\n  <iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mVyOVMFCQT4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Pablo suggested I try the \\\"Superman\\\" on the longest, fastest line.  Of course I complied, not knowing exactly what this was to be.  Normally the strap that connects the harness to the pulley comes up from around your belt buckle area, and you zip down in a position similar to sitting on a chaise lounge.  With the Superman, the attachment strap is moved to the back, so you are suspended face down, and attached to another person who is managing the braking.  I got into position, and one of the guys who works there hooked me up to his pulley.  He showed me my pulley and said \\\"cuarenta [forty] kilometers per hora\\\".  He pointed to his and with a big smile said \\\"<i>setenta</i> [seventy] kilometers per hora\\\".\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  So there I was, standing in front of the zip line master guy with my back to him, my attachment strap hooked to his 70kph pulley, him behind me.  \\\"Give me one leg,\\\" he said, so I raised one leg back.  \\\"Ok, now the other one\\\", now I was suspended, looking down at the treetops below.  The zipline stretches FAR into the distance.  \\\"Ready?\\\"  \\\"Oh yeah...\\\" and then off we went.  HOLY CRAP.  This was amazing.  Really really amazing, FLYING just above the trees SO FAST, hearing the high-pitched whine of the pulley, zipping past branches and through holes between trees, with my arms out like a bird.  I was just screaming like crazy it was such an absolutely terrific experience!!!  The landing platform came into view and I heard and felt the brake come in.  We landed perfectly on the platform.  Huge high-five for the helper, and a huge smile for the rest of the day for me.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We finished out the remaining lines, none more exciting than that one though.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After the zip lines, we hopped on the ATVs and rode to a spot outside of Montezuma to hike to a waterfall.  We parked in an unmarked spot, and walked along a hillside trail to a really magnificent place with water tumbling down rocks, then a 10 foot drop to a tree-lined pool, which then led to a 40 foot drop to another pool, then another 50 foot drop to the final pool.  Pablo had dove off all three, but neither Arti nor I wanted to do more than the 10-footer.  Marina and Naomi need functioning parents more than we need a thrill like that!  We spent some time jumping off the rocks and swimming in the refreshing fresh water.  It was a really beautiful place, complete with a Gold-Billed Heron in a nest just above the 40-foot falls.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Arti jumps into the pool:\\r\\n\\\n  <iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/drrqkJAO1p4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We swam as much as we wanted, then hiked back to the ATVs to get some lunch in Montezuma.  Pablo found a place for us that overlooked the ocean, and we had some good Costa Rican <i>Casado</i> (rice/beans plate).\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://360.io/6Ma4BU\\\">Click to view a panorama</a> of the largest ficus tree in the world, and winner of the 2009 Tree of the Year award.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  And <a href=\\\"http://360.io/rLwbbz\\\">here is another panorama</a> from a bridge we rode across on the way back.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Back to the hotel, and we parted ways with Pablo for the final time.  He was such an excellent guide and host.  His knowledge of the local culture, plants, animals, and willingness to show folks like us around was very much appreciated.  We exchanged email addresses, and I sincerely hope we cross paths again.  He sped off to prepare for a private dinner he was cooking for that night.  His true passion is gastronomy, and after he gets his Masters degree in Archaeology, he is going to go to culinary school in Italy, hoping to return to Costa Rica to use his skills to make uniquely Costa Rican food using plants that are indigenous to the area.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Thursday afternoon, we sulked around by the pool for a while, sad that our vacation was winding down.  However, we had our special dinner to look forward to.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://360.io/rbBKRG\\\">Here's a panorama of the pool area at Flor Blanca</a>.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We got cleaned up in the room, and then went down to the pool/dinner area to see the staff had set up the \\\"dojo\\\" for us to eat in.  This is a covered platform above one side of the pool where there are normally a couple of couches.  This is where we were going to enjoy Spencer and Billy's creations for us.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The meal started with a caprese \\\"shooter\\\", then a salad with lettuce, a bit of basil, and a couple of gorgonzola-stuffed mushrooms to top it off.  The next course was a succotash of asparagus, olives, and other winter veggies in a phenomenal red wine reduction.  The main course was a panko-stuffed tomato along side some tasty veggie orzo.  Dessert was a molten chocolate cake in a ramican with a small scoop of coffee ice cream on the side.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  It was great that the chefs at Flor Blanca would make such a special meal for us.  This is really a great example of the level of service we received all around there. \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <h3>Friday</h3>\\r\\n\\\n  We took a quick final walk on the beach before breakfast Friday.  After we ate, it was time to pack up and be ready for our 9:30a car ride to the airport.  We got to Tambor airport with plenty of time to spare, so we checked in (comprised of stepping on a scale and paying the $2.25 airport tax), and waited for our plane to arrive.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  We rode in a Cessna Caravan from Tambor back to San Jose.  We had three hours between those flights, so we took a taxi in to the city center for some souvenir shopping.  We got back to the airport to see that our flight was delayed a bit, which made us a little nervous since we had only an hour in Houston to go through customs, get our bags, and re-check them on the flight to San Francisco.  It ended up not being a problem at all ... we did all that in Houston in less than 30 minutes.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The flight back to San Francisco was delayed about an hour, which combined with arriving at 12:30a PT (2:30a CT) made it feel pretty long.  Driving home from the airport was a big test in stamina, since we had been traveling for the extent of the day.  \"\n:id: \"72157629098182904\"\n:excerpt: Thursday took us on a zip line tour, a waterfall hike, some pool time, and a special dinner from the Flor Blanca chefs.  We took one last walk up the beach on Friday, then came back home.\n"

  data: "--- \n:title: My Super Efficient Email Workflow\n:thumb_url: http://steinkamp.us/images/inbox_sections.png\n:content: |-\n  Like most people, email is a big part of my workday, as well as personal life.  Over the years I've worked out a very efficient way of going through the tons of email I receive, never missing an important message, and never having an oppressive number of unread messages.  I've realized that email can be used effectively as a to-do list, and use it accordingly.  Hopefully someone may find these tips bring more efficiency to their email lives!\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Ditch the Mouse</h3>\r\n  The mouse was a revolution in user interfaces.  It allowed us to have a GUI before touchscreens were commonplace.  It's served us pretty well, but it's horribly inefficient.  It's a single pixel of control, and requires us to do a fairly complex physical and mental switch to go from \"typing\" to \"mousing\".  Comparatively, typing is more than 10x more efficient -- your fingers are already on the keyboard, and while you can still only do one thing at the time, you have 10 pointing devices (your fingers) ready to act at a moment's notice.\r\n  \r\n  So get to know your computer's keyboard shortcuts.  If you're a Mac user, use Cmd-Tab to switch apps, Cmd-` (backtick, in the upper left corner of the keyboard) to cycle through windows in an app, Cmd-{ and Cmd-} to move through tabs in your browser window.  With those four shortcuts, you will not need the mouse at all to get to your email.\r\n  \r\n  I'm a big fan of the Spaces functionality in OSX.  I assign a space to a specific function, and a keyboard shortcut (Cmd-1, Cmd-2, etc) to each space.  This gives me single keystroke random access to a function.  Email?  Cmd-5.  Code? Cmd-2.  Music?  Cmd-3.  I'd confidently pit this against a \"big monitor\" solution that requires mousing or Cmd-tabbing to switch to an app.  Random access is just faster.\r\n  \r\n  In addition to learning your operating system's keyboard shortcuts, learn your mail program's keyboard shortcuts.  I use GMail exclusively, and their keyboard shortcuts are an option you can turn on (Mail Settings ... Keyboard Shortcuts On).  In GMail, you can press \"?\" at any time to bring up a popup with all the keyboard shortcuts!\r\n  \r\n  Important GMail keys:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>k - Next message up</li>\r\n  <li>j - Next message down</li>\r\n  <li>[space] - Scroll down (this is a web browser shortcut)</li>\r\n  <li>r - Reply</li>\r\n  <li>a - Reply All</li>\r\n  <li>c - Compose message</li>\r\n  <li>/ - Go to search box</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  So ditch the mouse.  Keyboarding is 10 times faster!\r\n  \r\n  <h3>GMail Setup</h3>\r\n  In the past year or so, Google added \"Inbox Sections\" functionality.  This is now a huge part of my workflow, and brought another big step in efficiency and accuracy to my email world.\r\n  \r\n  I have my Inbox sections set up this way:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>Unread</li>\r\n  <li>Starred</li>\r\n  <li>Everything Else</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <img src=\"/images/inbox_sections.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from GMail showing Inbox Sections\"/>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Email Workflow</h3>\r\n  With this setup, unread emails are always at the top of my email screen.  I have two primary ways of reading email - reviewing emails, and doing work.\r\n  \r\n  In this workflow, unread emails are my \"to-do now\" list.  Starred emails are my \"to-do later\" list.  Anything else is merely informational and can be found later using Labels or Search.\r\n  \r\n  To review emails, press \"gi\" to Go to the Inbox and update it.  Open the oldest Unread message thread (\"j\" key) and read it ([enter] key).  If it's just an \"fyi\" kind of thing, you're done with it!  Hit \"k\" to move to the next newer message.  If it's something you need to do \"soon\" (like after today) then press \"s\" to star the message.  It will now be in the \"Starred\" section of the Inbox.  If it's something you need to do \"now\" (like today), then press \"Shift-u\" to mark the message as Unread.\r\n  \r\n  PROTIP: Craziness like obsessing over an empty inbox or deleting emails are so 20th century.  Neither goal is worth spending any time on any more!  Just focus on reading things and organizing around what needs to be done.\r\n  \r\n  In this setup you will usually end up with only a few unread emails that represent things that need to be done now.  As you finish those things, reply to the email (\"Done. -zs\") and now it's out of your view.  As you can finish the to-dos that are Starred, unstar them.  I don't really use folders/labels, but I can imagine how they may be useful for some people.  In GMail, to assign a label to a message, just press \"l\" (small \"ell\") when you're reading the message, then start typing the label name.  Fast!\r\n  \r\n  I know this workflow cut my time spent in email by more than 75%, and helps me stay on top of information and things that need to be done.  If you have some workflow tips, then please share below!\n:excerpt: |\n  Like most people, email is a big part of my workday, as well as personal life.

  data: "--- \n:title: Crepes!\n:description: |-\n  Crepes are surprisingly simple and quick.  They don't take any special skill or equipment to make, and they don't need to be prepared the night before.\r\n  \r\n  Here's the recipe we use:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>1 cup flour</li>\r\n  <li>A little more than 1 cup milk</li>\r\n  <li>1 egg</li>\r\n  <li>1 tbsp melted butter</li>\r\n  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  \r\n  Just mix all that together in a bowl with a whisk.  Make it as smooth as possible.  This will be enough for 2-3 people.  Increase the amounts as appropriate -- I use 1.5x for our family.\r\n  \r\n  Get a skillet pancake-hot (350F), and spread a thin coat of oil on it with a paper towel.  It takes only a tiny bit.  I use a stainless skillet -- no need for nonstick here.  In fact, I think stainless makes it easier.\r\n  \r\n  Get a plate ready to receive the cooked crepes.  Put a piece of foil over the top to keep them nice and warm.\r\n  \r\n  Take a scoop of the batter with a 1/2c measuring cup and pour it in the center of the hot skillet.  Grab the skillet handle and spread it out to a uniform thin layer.  Let it cook for 45 seconds or so, then flip it.  Another 15 seconds, and it's probably done.  The first side should be golden brown.  The other side will be less golden, but obviously done (not wet looking).\r\n  \r\n  Serving suggestions:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>Spread butter, ceylon cinnamon, a bit of salt, and maple syrup on the crepe.  Roll it up, and eat the delicious spiral log of joy.</li>\r\n  <li>Put a scrambled or fried egg with salt and pepper in the crepe.  Add grated cheese, and wrap up like a burrito.  Microwave it for 15-30 seconds if need be to melt the cheese.</li>\r\n  <li>Slice strawberries, and add yogurt or whipped cream.  Some toasted sliced almonds are delicious with this.</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  What else do you put in your crepes?\n"

Allison, and Monument Peak every possible way now.  Looking at Google Earth and talking with Arti, I decided to see how to get up Black Mountain.  It's a 2800 foot peak to the west of Mountain View and Los Altos.  Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve is the closest park, and provides a great route up.\r\n  \r\n  It took only 15 minutes to get to the RSAOSP parking lot from home.  I spotted a ranger at the trail head, and I asked him what the best way to Black Mountain was.\r\n  \r\n  \"Do you want to go the normal way, or the most direct way?\", he asked.\r\n  \r\n  Today was a direct way sort of day, so he described the path up the PG&E trail (under power lines), then hanging a left at what he called the \"Potty Trail\" -- an unofficial single track twister that shaves at least a mile off the normal route, then finishing up on the Black Mountain Trail.\r\n  \r\n  In describing the Potty Trail the ranger said, \"there's a trail there, and you'll see it, but it's NOT kept to our standards.\"\r\n  \r\n  Little did he know, this was less a warning and more an endorsement to me!\r\n  \r\n  It was a good hike, covering 12-13 miles out-and back.  Lots of shade, and the Potty Trail was definitely the highlight.  I got to the top in a bit more than 2 hours, and back down in 1:40, running a good part of the way down.\r\n  \r\n  Here's a screenshot from Google Earth:\r\n  <p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/7058529335/\" title=\"Rancho San Antonio to Black Mountain by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5461/7058529335_4c1054a13e_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"349\" alt=\"Rancho San Antonio to Black Mountain\"></a></p>\r\n  And you can <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=216260364569572714769.0004bd335d878f4d366ae&msa=0&ll=37.324692,-122.117379&spn=0.044911,0.074844\">view the path in Google Maps here</a>.\n:excerpt: Today I decided to try something new, since I'm pretty sure I've gone up and down Mission Peak, Mt.

  data: "--- \n:title: \"DIY: iPhone Macro\"\n:thumb_url: http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5463/6952936838_2b463ec3d1_q.jpg\n:excerpt: It's easy to capture amazing close-up photos with your smartphone.  All you need is a nerdy motivation and a little magnifier...\n:content: |-\n  I was playing with a big toy magnifying glass with my daughters one day, and thought, \"hmm, I wonder if I can use this with a camera\".  Sure enough, it worked, but the big plastic lens in the toy had quality issues.  With a better lens, this could be a really interesting thing!\r\n  \r\n  So I did a bit of googling and found the site <a href=\"http://www.opticsplanet.net/\">Optics Planet</a>.  They have many different magnifiers, from <a href=\"http://www.opticsplanet.net/konus-4x-quicklens-magnifiers-3239.html\">very cheap models</a> to <a href=\"http://www.opticsplanet.net/zeiss-optics-3x-6x-aplanatic-achromatic-pocket-magnifier-d36.html\">\"Whoa! That's pricey!\" items from Carl Zeiss</a>.\r\n  \r\n  I settled on the next tier down from Zeiss, which is a range from Bausch and Lomb called <a href=\"http://images1.opticsplanet.com/365-240-ffffff/opplanet-bausch-lomb-triplet-magnifiers-3-1.jpg\">Hastings Triplet Loupes</a>.  They are a three element design, and had good quality reviews.  I also liked how it had a metal body with a loop for a lanyard or other tether.

One of the most useful is the Doppler Radar overlay, which usually shows precipitation level on a colorful scale.\r\n  \r\n  One thing I've noticed on the radar overlay is that there is an area in the north bay, near Fairfield and Rio Vista that appears to always have storm-level activity over it.  \r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/6954885862/\" title=\"NEXRAD radar overlay by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8142/6954885862_9acf5ab335_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"547\" alt=\"NEXRAD radar overlay\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  It's near the bay, so I had thought that it was possibly a swamp or marsh area with high levels of evaporation that was confusing the radar.  Or perhaps it was the Bay Area's version of the Bermuda Triangle and there was indeed a raging storm over that spot.  Searching the web didn't turn up anything useful.  So I decided to take a closer look in Google Earth.\r\n  \r\n  Here's a view of the overall area...\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/6954897770/\" title=\"Rio Vista - Far by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7108/6954897770_c89f403a7f_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"476\" alt=\"Rio Vista - Far\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  Zooming in a bit shows some clues...\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/7100966993/\" title=\"Rio Vista - Medium by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7044/7100966993_4b8a674191_z.jpg\" width=\"548\" height=\"435\" alt=\"Rio Vista - Medium\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  Zooming way in gives us our answer...\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/7100966935/\" title=\"Rio Vista - close by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8019/7100966935_b5fce8cf0f_z.jpg\" width=\"639\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Rio Vista - close\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  Aha!  Windmills!  The spinning blades are indeed motion in the air.  This is exactly what Doppler radar is designed to pick up.  The weather radar apparently cannot distinguish between precipitation and spinning windmill blades.\r\n  \r\n  Looking back at the weather radar, now I see that there is another similar area of perpetual storm near Altamont, CA, which is a more familiar wind-farm area.\r\n  \r\n  Case closed!\r\n\n:excerpt: |\n  In the weather app I use on my phone, there is a map view with configurable overlays.

We bought the car new, and it has about 90K miles on it now.  Overall, it's been a great car and still looks and drives very nicely.  I've noticed though over the past year or so that it feels a bit \"wallowy\" in some situations.  Usually I felt that in in sweeping turns with some undulations -- the car felt like it was moving around more than it should, and felt less stable than it should.  Sounds like the shocks are done!\n:content: |-\n  Shocks, or better called \"dampers\", resist motion of the springs and tires in the car's suspension.  Without a shock absorber, your tires would be bouncing wildly whenever you drove over any sort of bump.  Tires are like rubber balls, and they're held to the car with springs -- lots of bouncing potential there!  Shocks also slow down slower movements in the suspension, like as the car leans to one side in a turn or squats down under acceleration.  \r\n  \r\n  The damping power of the shock should be matched to the springs and tires on the car, otherwise the springs will either overwhelm the shocks or the shocks will overdamp the springs.  If you've ever ridden in a lowered car with an uncomfortable ride, it's likely that the owner just cut the springs for looks and kept the stock shocks.  With the right shock, very stiff springs can still be comfortable.\r\n  \r\n  Next time you're a passenger in a car on the freeway, look at the tires of cars around you -- chances are you will be able to pick out a car with dead shocks -- its tires will be \"flapping\" up and down over bumps, rather than just riding smoothly over them.  It's a difficult thing to feel as a driver, especially if the shock has died a slow death.  Without tires connected to the pavement, your traction and safety are compromised.\r\n  \r\n  I spent the bulk of yesterday replacing the shocks on Arti's car -- a 2007 328i wagon.  We bought the car new, and it has about 90K miles on it now.  Overall, it's been a great car and still looks and drives very nicely.  I've noticed though over the past year or so that it feels a bit \"wallowy\" in some situations.  Usually I felt that in in sweeping turns with some undulations -- the car felt like it was moving around more than it should, and felt less stable than it should.  Sounds like the shocks are done!\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/7124730511/\" title=\"Arti at Laguna Seca by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8151/7124730511_f7fa2296a6_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"449\" alt=\"Arti at Laguna Seca\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  I had asked for some recommendations for aftermarket shocks from a group of trusted friends.  Koni has a shock called \"FSD\" which employs some magical internal valving to provide improved comfort and handling, but reviews on those were mixed.  My experience with magic is that it's usually not great.  I've had good experience with Bilstein shocks on other cars, and have a set on my current car, but it's set up very stiff -- stiffer than what Arti would like in her car.  Bilstein sells an \"HD\" line of shocks, but while those are not as stiff as those in my car, people have said they're much stiffer than stock, and too stiff for stock springs.\r\n  \r\n  A friend recommended Bilstein's \"Touring Class\" shocks, which match the original dimensions of the factory shocks, and provide a very slightly more sporty ride than the original shocks.  They're designed to be used with the stock springs, and even come specialized for if the car has the \"regular\" or \"sport\" suspension from the factory.\r\n  \r\n  <img src=\"http://www.tirerack.com/images/suspension/search_susp/large/bilstein_21_030338_l.jpg\"/>\r\n  \r\n  I bought a set from AJUSA for about $400 shipped, and they arrived last week.  I decided to put them on the car this past Saturday, and it ended up being a 6 hour job, including an oil change.  It took so long mostly because I had to disassemble most of the rear of the interior of her car to get to the rear shock towers.  Also, since we were using the stock springs, I needed to use spring compressors for the front struts.  Spring compressors are medieval torture devices to punish those who don't have air tools.  Anyhow, the job went smoothly with no damage to the car and only slight damage to my hands.\r\n  \r\n  First test drive report?  Great!  The car doesn't have any unnecessary movements through fast turns or over bumps any more.  Somehow the car is more quiet than before ... I don't understand how this could be, but both Arti and I came to this conclusion independently.  It's still a very comfortable ride, but so much funner to drive now.\r\n  \r\n  So if your car doesn't feel planted to the road, or has lost some of that feel from what you remember from its younger days, it's worth checking out if the shocks need replacing.\n"

My plan was to go right/straight off into the dirt since I was 100% committed to braking and he was blocking any path to the left.  Just as I was about to go by, he gets off the brakes (maybe onto the gas?!?!) and spears me in the driver's side.<br />\n  <br />\n  The nose of my car was undamaged, but there was sheetmetal damage to the front fender, door, and a small amount of damage to the rear quarter.  The long bolt that holds the rear lower control arm to the upright was bent, the rear wheel was broken, and I ended up with some additional toe-out in the left front.<br />\n  <br />\n  Thanks to Fish and Justin of Evil Genius Racing, the car was back on track in just over an hour and felt as good as it did before the accident.

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  I ordered a pair of New Balance MT-1010 earlier this week from <a href=\"http://zombierunner.com/\">Zombie Runner</a>, and they came in just in time today for a Friday night hike.  The 1010 is a great evolution of the Minimus, particularly in terms of downhill grip.\r\n  \r\n  Felt great from the beginning.  I think I'm starting to get to know my warmup ramp and how to feel out the best pace.\r\n  \r\n  Side note -- Saw a guy throwing up at the base of Cardiac Hill (Arti's name for that steep part near the top), then shook it off and ran the rest of the way up.  Beast mode!\r\n  \r\n  Still, I'm pleased with knocking 1:34 off of my prior best time.  The bonus part is my feet and legs still feel great.  It's all about the shoes!\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/7855009724/\" title=\"MT1010 at the top of Mission Peak by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7110/7855009724_f1a2062f66_z.jpg\" width=\"478\" height=\"640\" alt=\"MT1010 at the top of Mission Peak\"></a>\n:thumb_url: http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7110/7855009724_f1a2062f66_s.jpg\n:excerpt: Beautiful Friday night hike/run up Mission Peak from Stanford Ave in a new pair of New Balance MT1010s.\n:title: MP new PB - 53:29.

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  I took advantage of the day off by rearranging the garage a bit.  While the girls rode their bikes in the front yard, I collected all the strollers -- there are four in the garage right now -- into a corner.  This freed up some wall space where I could make holder for Arti's nice road bike to hold it up by the frame crossbar vs. hanging by the rim how we had it.  I used some scrap 3/4\" plywood to make two thin pieces that I screwed perpendicular to the studs.  I shaped them so the frame would nestle into a dip in the rail, rounded all the edges, then covered them in rubbery shelf liner.  Works great, and it's a lot easier to store and retrieve than the hanging method.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/7927584826/\" title=\"Bike Holder-Upper by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8443/7927584826_b50c730ec1_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Bike Holder-Upper\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  As I was finishing, I got an invite from Sean Kohler (Arti had just been riding with his wife) to go for a mountain bike ride.  It's been 12 years since I've ridden a mountain bike in earnest.  He had a spare (mine is far from useable), and I will look for any excuse to get into some spandex (kidding!).  \r\n  \r\n  We drove to Kennedy Trail, then I spent the next hour and a half huffing and puffing up the steep hills watching him easily tear up the trail.  I was on his sweet full suspension 29er, and he was on the family \"spare bike\", yet he was making it look so simple.\r\n  \r\n  <div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/7927553622/\" title=\"Riding up Kennedy Trail by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8307/7927553622_ec7edae8d3_z.jpg\" width=\"478\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Riding up Kennedy Trail\"></a></div>\r\n  \r\n  At the top of the hill (2800 ft) we turned around and bombed back down.  What a rush!  I've never been on a full suspension bike before, and it was really incredible.  Fast, smooth, in complete control.  Neat stuff.\r\n  \r\n  About 3/4 of the way down, there was a woman stopped on the side of the trail that we had passed on the way up.  She was walking a huge Marmaduke-sized dog, but the dog was laying beside her.  Once we got close it was pretty clear to me the dog was dead.  She asked us for water, and we gave her what we had, but there was no use.  She was really upset -- not just for the dog, but that she hadn't seen signs of trouble (she was a doctor).  Poor lady.  We stayed with her for a while, then left when she assured us she was fine and the ranger was on the way to help bring the dog down.\r\n  \r\n  We got to the bottom a few minutes later.  Fun times!  I'm looking at bikes now, though I know I won't get something quite as nice as Sean let me ride...  Any suggestions?\n:thumb_url: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8307/7927553622_ec7edae8d3_q.jpg\n:excerpt: We celebrated Labor today with some bicycle-oriented garage projects, and I went for a ride with Sean Kohler, after 12 years away from a mountain bike.\n:title: Labor Day Bike Day\n"

We made it to the top about 15 minutes faster than last time -- the cool air helped quite a bit.\r\n  \r\n   About a third of the way down, I was ahead of him and I heard him yelp.  I stopped, turned around, and pedaled back up the hill.  Thankfully he was still on the trail, but he had the bike upside-down and had already removed the back wheel.  The brakes had heated up the rim so much that the valve stem melted off the tube!  He was halfway done replacing the tube when I got up to him (fast!).  We went to pump up the tube, but the little pin in the pump had broken off and so there was nothing to push on the valve to open it to let air in.  We walked down a bit, then we decided to put a little pebble in the pump to push in the valve pin.  That worked!  So we were back in the saddle to bomb back down the hill.\r\n  \r\n  I'm even more motivated now to get a bike of my own... probably this week.\r\n  \r\n  Update 3PM same day ... \"this week\" was a little short-sighted.  Brought <a href=\"http://www.cannondale.com/2012-trail-sl-29er-4-20758\">this one</a> home today from <a href=\"http://wheelaway.com\">Wheel Away</a> in Campbell.

  data: "--- \n:description: |-\n  I got off the train this morning in Mountain View and rode my bike to Moffett Field to watch the Space Shuttle fly over.  Marina and I were going to do this, but then it was delayed and delayed into impracticality.  My original plan today was to just watch it from the Groupon roof in Palo Alto, but at the CalTrain stop in Mountain View I realized that the train was now also late, and I could get to Moffett quickly from here.  So I went for it.\r\n  \r\n  The ride to Moffett was quick.  I rode past hundreds of cars queued up to get in through the two lane entrance.  It must have taken some people the better part of an hour to get in.  Once I was in, there were signs directing everyone to a viewing area.  Dedications and announcements echoed through the complex from a stage and PA system.  As I went through the opening in the fence that led to the tarmac, I saw the sea of people milling about in the viewing area -- a space about 100x200 yards.  There must have been ten thousand people there.\r\n  \r\n  I found a nice spot to set my bike, sat down on the ground, and did a little work in the hour or so I had to wait.  People were abuzz with theories, predictions, facts, and memories of the shuttle.  Nerd paradise.\r\n  \r\n  This event made me think of the real value in something like the Shuttle program.  Today's America is consumed with short term, profit-focused decision making.  There is nothing profitable in the short term about space exploration, and so in this era of privatization I'm not sure we'll see a gamble as big as the Space Shuttle or the Gemini program.\r\n  \r\n  The shuttle was a magical thing for me as a kid.  I was 6 when it was first launched, and it's pretty much the only thing I would draw during that year.  I read every book I could get my hands on from the library about it.  It inspired me to dream about science; it legitimized learning math and computers; it showed me a collection of real heroes -- the astronauts -- who were the smartest, most athletic, kindest group of people that could be assembled.\r\n  \r\n  The benefit of the shuttle program goes far beyond a quick buck.  It helped to shape a generation of engineers and dreamers who would go on to make the next leap in technology and culture.\r\n  \r\n  Investments in public programs like these are what keeps a people on the right path of motivation, something that I fear we're losing to short-term, money-driven decision making.\r\n  \r\n  \"There it is!\" shouted a guy behind me, pointing to the north.  The graceful wings of the 747 were just visible above the Moffett tower.  Little kids yelped.  Camera shutters clacked and whirred.  Everyone's attention was aligned at that moment to see the Shuttle atop its transport, paraded past its admirers, with a quiet roar as it passed by en route to its resting place.  Headed for silent, occasional attention ... in a museum, with other cultural artifacts.\n:title: Shuttle Flyby\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  I hit the trail at 8am today in Ed Levin County Park.  It was a beautiful, cool, sunny morning ... mid-50s.  The plan was to take the Calera Creek Trail to the Agua Caliente Trail, along the Bay Area Ridge Trail, then up and over Mission Peak, and back behind the peak.  I added a bit extra after the Peak to get a bit more distance.\r\n  \r\n  It was an ideal day out there today -- warm sun and cool breeze.  I covered 16 miles, 4200 ft elevation gain, in 3h40m.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8064428539/\" title=\"Ed Levin to Mission Peak and Back by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8310/8064428539_b61ea6e048_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Ed Levin to Mission Peak and Back\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  Today was the first time out where I was happy running uphill.  Prior to today I would get really tired after just a bit of uphill work.  Today I made a point to push through that fatigue, and managed to run all the way from Monument Peak, behind Mt. Allison, and up the south side of Mission Peak, down the north side, and back without walking.  Stopping every few miles for a minute to stretch my knees/quads helped too.\r\n  \r\n  On the way down I passed a feisty little rattlesnake.  It was much more aggressive than any adult rattler I'd passed before -- it's like it wanted to eat me!\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8064428947/\" title=\"Ed Levin to Mission Peak and Back by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8039/8064428947_84712af5fd_z.jpg\" width=\"626\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Ed Levin to Mission Peak and Back\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  Arti had the genius idea to pack a little cooler with ice-cold treats for the end of the hike: a can of soda water, a super delicious pear, and a huge chunk of watermelon.  I found a shady spot near the car and enjoyed the cool goodness!\r\n  \r\n  I did another cold soak once I got home, which really helps my feet and legs recover.  They're tired, but I don't feel crippled like I have in the past!\n:thumb_url: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8039/8064428947_84712af5fd_q.jpg\n:title: Ed Levin to Mission Peak and Back\n:excerpt: I hit the trail at 8am today in Ed Levin County Park.

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  (I've been writing this in my head for a couple of months now, and here's an opportunity to get it out.)\r\n  \r\n  <img style=\"float:right;\" src=\"http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/4ca9f6bb7f8b9a0d76650000/groupon-cat.jpg\">I started at Groupon more than two years ago now.  I was excited about the company then, but I'm way more excited now.  This may come as a surprise to someone who only follows the market or the Silicon Valley tabloids, but for me, Groupon is the place to be.  Here's why:\r\n  \r\n  <ol>\r\n  <li><b>The Business</b> - Groupon's core mission is to get people out from in front of the computer, out of the house, and trying new things.  We succeed when we help people find an awesome new restaurant that they love to bring their family to, or when someone tries skydiving, or when you take your friends out bowling for the first time in years.  We continue to succeed when we help local businesses acquire new customers.  We win when people are out and about in their town, spending money at their neighborhood shops.  I think this is a net positive for society, and a stark contrast to most other online businesses.  For comparison: Amazon wins when you stop buying stuff from local businesses (worse than WalMart!).  Facebook or Google make money only when you spend more time on Facebook or Google looking at their ads.  I prefer to work for a company whose motivation is a societal good.</li>\r\n  \r\n  <li><b>Andrew Mason</b> - The guy is a humble genius.  He's the real deal, and shoulders a lot of responsibility for building...</li>\r\n  \r\n  <li><b>The Team</b> - This is a seriously talented group.  From the original crew who started The Point to the team now.  The engineering team has grown from 25 people when I started to more than 300 now.  The level of consistent quality of people I get to work with is off the charts -- not only in technical aptitude, but in demeanor, attitude, and interesting hobbies.  A significant portion of the engineering team growth has come from acquisitions, so there's a distinct lean toward \"entrepreneurial\" in Groupon's culture.  This is a great thing.  Humor is one of our core competencies and it permeates all aspects of our office life.  This makes things which would otherwise be dull at most companies into big fun.</li>\r\n  \r\n  <li><b>International</b> - We're taking what we've learned and built for the US business and rolling it out to the rest of the world.  If it works internationally as it has worked in the US, we will see a significant revenue lift from improved deal targeting and product experience.</li>\r\n  \r\n  <li><b>Merchant OS</b> - We're expanding beyond the Daily Deals market into what we call the \"Merchant OS\".  This is tools and services for merchants to help them do a better job, and to save money over existing systems.  We've announced an online appointment scheduling system, iOS based credit card processing system, a restaurant management system.  There are more very interesting projects in the works.  I think we're uniquely positioned to succeed in this market because of the personal relationships we've forged with tens of thousands of local businesspeople.  This is a significant asset that no other company can match, and why a typical technology company will fail to make inroads.</li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  \r\n  So those are the big reasons why I've decided to dedicate my work time to Groupon.  Maybe you'd like to join me?\n:thumb_url: http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/4ca9f6bb7f8b9a0d76650000/groupon-cat.jpg\n:excerpt: I started at Groupon more than two years ago now.

Friday was an Instructor Training School, and Saturday/Sunday was the standard High Performance Driver Education, where I got the opportunity to teach the C Group classroom along with doing in-car instruction.  A great weekend, but I'm also glad to be home!\n:content: |-\n  Just got home from three days at Thunderhill Raceway with the GGC BMWWCCA.  \r\n  \r\n  Friday was an Instructor Training School.  The club does this once every couple of years to refresh old instructors skills, and to haze/vet/train new instructors.  I was assigned a new recruit (who had more years instructing than me, just with other groups) and my role was to play the \"bad student\".  Andy, the candidate instructor, was a great guy and we got along well all day.  I tried hard in the morning to be my best Knucklehead McStudent for him (\"yeah, I'm going to set fast lap in this group ... I've got a lot of laps here on xbox.\").  In the afternoon I threw him some more subtle situations, like creeping in prior to turn-in, or distracting myself with irrelevant banter.  Andy did great and caught all my foibles.  We're lucky to have him join the instructor corps!  \r\n  \r\n  We also got 5 open track sessions on Friday, so I got plenty of time in to have fun and polish my own skills out there.\r\n  \r\n  Saturday and Sunday were a standard BMWCCA track weekend.  I had one student in the C (low intermediate) group each day and taught the C classroom, a first for me.  Both of my students were fantastic and made great progress each day.  The classroom was the highlight of the weekend though.\r\n  \r\n  There were 25 or so C group students.  After each driving session, we would convene to discuss the session, and to review other topics related to driving.\r\n  \r\n  We started the weekend with a chat about the skills and attributes needed to be a fast driver.  The main focus was on developing smoothness, and what's needed for that (confidence, relaxation, a good sense of what the car is doing, etc).  We also talked about the attributes of a good student (eagerness, listening, humility, turning words into action, etc).  The group really responded well to this -- I had their rapt attention through the whole classroom.\r\n  \r\n  In the next session, we focused on what to do if the car is going to leave the track.  I showed a video of mine where I went 4-off in turn 9.  We looked at the video frame-by-frame to show when to make the decision to stop trying to save the corner, and instead go straight off.  There were three 4-off incidents in the group after that, and none of them resulted in any spins or damage to the car.  Hopefully our analysis helped contribute to the lack of drama.\r\n  \r\n  <embed src=\"http://video.thenobot.org/20120910-pdc_thunderhill_s2_t9_off.mov\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" scale=\"aspect\" autostart=\"false\"></embed>\r\n  \r\n  In subsequent sessions, we talked a lot about passing.  Since it was such a great group, we didn't have any stories of frustration from the track, but we did talk through turning a \"train\" scenario into a positive learning experience by taking advantage of the situation to learn to drive our own line.  We also reinforced the idea of finishing the turn prior to taking or giving the passing signal.\r\n  \r\n  On Sunday, I wanted to focus on the track and lines.  In the morning, I had an idea to use Google Earth to do this.  There are some annotation tools in Google Earth that you can use to draw lines on the ground.  Perfect for drawing lines on the track.  There is also \"street view\" of Thunderhill that you can click into to see the view from the ground.\r\n  \r\n  This went over better than I expected.  Utilizing the new 55\" TV and surrounding couches in the main classroom, we had a super high tech learning tool, where we could zoom around the track in 3D, looking at individual turns and how they relate to each other.  This worked out to be AWESOME.  It was like a classroom from the future...\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8179051989/\" title=\"Overall View by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8340/8179051989_3012217b1f_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"372\" alt=\"Overall View\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  We could flip to a video of that turn to watch and dissect it, then flip back to the Earth view and discuss the line more.  Super super useful.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8179052271/\" title=\"Turns 2, 3, 4 by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8205/8179052271_b9d17d02eb_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"393\" alt=\"Turns 2, 3, 4\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  Here is the .kmz file that includes the annotations for the lines on the track.  <a href=\"/Thunderhill_Cyclone_Lines.kmz\">Thunderhill_Cyclone_Lines.kmz</a> (open in Google Earth).\r\n  \r\n  Here is the video we used in the classroom:\r\n  <embed src=\"http://video.thenobot.org/20121109-thill_bmwcca_instructor_school_laps.mov\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" scale=\"aspect\" autostart=\"false\"></embed>\r\n  <a href=\"http://video.thenobot.org/20121109-thill_bmwcca_instructor_school_laps-full.mov\">(Download Full HD Version)</a>\r\n  \r\n  Some students were recording video from the track, so we watched some of their videos and talked about how video can be such a useful learning tool while away from the track.\r\n  \r\n  After the last classroom session on both Saturday and Sunday, we took a \"field trip\" to a spot around the track where we could see the track from a new viewpoint.  On Saturday we walked up the hill above Turn 1.  Along the way we talked about how the turn goes uphill, and then we watched the A Group (Advanced) students on track.  On Sunday, we walked out to the pavement near T10 and T11 to look at the shape of things there.  One day I'd like to work out how to bring the group out to walk the whole track.\r\n  \r\n  It was really fun to get to know all the C group students.  What a great bunch.\r\n  \r\n  Overall, a great weekend with some new experiences and friends.  All that being said, I'm glad to be back home with my three favorite people.  I'm probably going to take the next 6 months off from driving stuff so that I can focus on training for the Ohlone Wilderness 50K coming up in May.\n:thumb_url: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8340/8179051989_3012217b1f_q.jpg\n:title: Thunderhill 3-Day Weekend\n"

  data: "--- \n:excerpt: \"\"\n:content: |-\n  With the <a href=\"http://ohlone50k.com\">Ohlone 50K</a> looming in May, I've been inspired to get back out there on foot on the trails.  After a few weeks away, this weekend was the time to get back into it.  \r\n  \r\n  My initial plan was to follow the O50K course up and over Mission Peak then run down to the gate at Calaveras Road and back (about 15 miles total), but at the point where I'd start running toward Calaveras I decided to cut it short.  Mimi and Pop are coming into town, and we're going to decorate the tree with them and Kanta.  Also I needed to do some yardwork and hang the Christmas lights, so I didn't want to be totally zonked out.  Anyhow, those are my excuses for cutting it short!\r\n  \r\n  Here's the route:\r\n  <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=204175310944031498999.0004cf434739fb2405362&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=f&amp;ll=37.509045,-121.893654&amp;spn=0.032681,0.054932&amp;z=14&amp;ecpose=37.48237593,-121.89365387,3296.71,0,44.973,0&amp;output=embed\"></iframe><br /><small>View <a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=204175310944031498999.0004cf434739fb2405362&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=f&amp;ll=37.509045,-121.893654&amp;spn=0.032681,0.054932&amp;z=14&amp;ecpose=37.48237593,-121.89365387,3296.71,0,44.973,0&amp;source=embed\" style=\"color:#0000FF;text-align:left\">Mission Peak 10 Miles</a> in a larger map</small>\r\n  \r\n  Arti and I went to Zombie Runner last night to pick up a new pair of shoes -- I ended up getting a pair of <a href=\"http://www.zombierunner.com/store/brands/altra_running/product4349.html\">Altra Running Superior</a> shoes to try out.  I've enjoyed the Minimus that I've been running in, but mine are about a half size too short and I was going to experiment with something with a little more cushion.  The Altras in 13 fit the bill.  I'm normally 11.5 but running downhill demands some extra toe space.  The Altras have a nice roomy toe box, and are made of some really great feeling materials.\r\n  \r\n  <img src=\"http://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server2500/71da5/products/156/images/1928/superior7__85510.1350419683.1280.1280.jpg\" width=640>\r\n  \r\n  Even with the steep downhill of MP, my feet feel great.  No signs of blisters anywhere, and my index toes aren't bruised up -- which was the main reason for looking at different shoes.\r\n  \r\n  Just as I started down the trail, my body really perked up and I felt great.  It was a beautiful day out there today -- about 70 degrees, sunny, with a cool breeze.  With some good music playing, it was one kind of heaven!  In that situation I can just run and run...\r\n  \r\n  When I was almost to the bottom, the Parks Department helicopter was circling the peak, and announcing something over the PA.  There were two Fremont Police Department SUVs at the bottom.  I'm not sure what was going on, but it probably wasn't good.\n:thumb_url: http://www.zombierunner.com/store/media/images_new/altra_running/x75/superior_mens_green_hero.jpg\n:title: Back in the Saddle\n"

It was settled in 1876, and people lived there until 1979.  Now it's just a run-down, vandalized collection of structures along the Union Pacific Railroad.\r\n  \r\n  <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=204175310944031498999.0004d22e65acf6d4a75fc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=37.445698,-121.976395&amp;spn=0.065418,0.109863&amp;z=13&amp;output=embed\"></iframe><br /><small>View <a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=204175310944031498999.0004d22e65acf6d4a75fc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=37.445698,-121.976395&amp;spn=0.065418,0.109863&amp;z=13&amp;source=embed\" style=\"color:#0000FF;text-align:left\">Drawbridge</a> in a larger map</small>\r\n  \r\n  The ride there was pretty muddy, and I had to walk (run) with my bike through the last mile or so along the train tracks.  \r\n  \r\n  After I had explored what I wanted to explore, I heard a train horn in the distance.  I froze.  It sounded again, this time louder.  I didn't want to get caught out there since I was either on Union Pacific land or off-limits of the East Bay Regional Park district, so I hid behind a concrete wall near the train bridge where the engineer couldn't see me.\r\n  \r\n  The Amtrak train passed overhead with a powerful thundering force.  I got some photos of it as it passed by.  One is in this set.\r\n  \r\n  I knew there wouldn't be another train for a while, so I hustled back to the safety of the trail and rode the few miles back to the car.\n:id: \"72157632398454252\"\n:photos: \n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:03:16\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8491/8330666813_120e9645f3_s.jpg\n  :description: Before I got started.\n  :id: \"8330666813\"\n  :title: Bike at the ready\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:38:22\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8219/8330667095_bf00f0ee74_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8330667095\"\n  :title: Closing in on Drawbridge\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:39:10\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8074/8331724976_6b4eca4b4a_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8331724976\"\n  :title: Creepy Eyes\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:39:33\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8083/8330667555_6afcdc0d2e_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8330667555\"\n  :title: Falling apart\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:41:26\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8224/8330667787_1aa54bbec6_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8330667787\"\n  :title: Bike waits\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:42:19\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8356/8331725824_5dbc42bf7d_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8331725824\"\n  :title: Train Bridge\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:43:41\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8494/8330668477_8ece6002a2_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8330668477\"\n  :title: Not Current\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:48:14\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8221/8330668789_535ac9205a_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8330668789\"\n  :title: Barn Teeters\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:47:25\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8224/8330668983_120dd617ac_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8330668983\"\n  :title: Barn Interior\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:49:29\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8361/8331727172_e4b1f4990e_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8331727172\"\n  :title: Barn leaning\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:50:20\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8219/8330669583_346ea9aa83_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8330669583\"\n  :title: Barn and Mission Peak\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 11:59:09\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8502/8330669809_a4114ec16e_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8330669809\"\n  :title: Amtrak Speeds Away\n- :pub_date: 2012-12-31 12:08:04\n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8080/8331727998_870c70ea89_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :id: \"8331727998\"\n  :title: Duck Pond\n:title: 20121231 Drawbridge\n:num_photos: 13\n"

Here's what it took...\n:content: |\n  This is a project I've wanted to do since we moved in.  With just a few simple parts, I installed independent remote speakers into our dining room.  What I wanted was a system that was simple, controllable from an iPhone via AirPlay, and that didn't require going to another room and turning something on before we could listen to music.\r\n  \r\n  Here are the parts that will do the job:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>In-Wall Speakers: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006I5O6\">Polk RC85i</a> - $150/pr</li>\r\n    <li>Amplifier: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00026BQJ6\">AudioSource AMP-100</a> - $90</li>\r\n    <li>Sound Source: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008ALA2RC\">Apple AirPort Express</a> - $100</li>\r\n    <li>Speaker Wire: <a href=\"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16882876048\">Generic CL2-rated (inside wall) 14 gauge, 100ft</a> - $20</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  \r\n  The AirPort Express shows up as remote speakers in iTunes and in many iOS apps including Spotify and Music, so we end up \"beaming\" music to it through the home network.  The AirPort Express has an audio Line-Out jack that is connected to one of the inputs on the amplifier.  The speakers are connected to the amplifier.  The amp has a volume knob, but we just set it to a loud setting and use the volume control on the iTunes/iPhone to make it quieter.\r\n  \r\n  Here is a screenshot from the \"Remote\" app on my iPhone showing what is playing on the speakers and with the volume control:\r\n  <div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8365817631/\" title=\"Remote App by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8212/8365817631_1e31b789c4_n.jpg\" width=\"213\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Remote App\"></a>\r\n  </div>\r\n  \r\n  Despite being inexpensive, the amp has some nice specs and feels like it's built very well.  It's heavy and the switches and dials feel way nicer than any consumer electronics gear I've owned.  One essential feature is that it has auto-standby ... so it's not a power hog unless it's getting an input signal.  It also has two sets of inputs -- A and B.  If there is a signal on input A, it will switch from B to play the signal from input A.  Once there is no signal on input A it will switch back to B.  This has the side effect of switching from A to B in between songs if the AirPort is connected to input A.  PROTIP: Connect the AirPort to input B to avoid this annoying problem!\r\n  \r\n  The speakers were super easy to install.  Just measure and cut a hole in the drywall in between studs.  Drill a tiny hole where you think the center should be and use some stiff wire to fish around in the space to ensure there are no hidden obstructions.  \r\n  \r\n  <div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8365809801/\" title=\"Speaker Install by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8084/8365809801_b0ef7da67f_n.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Speaker Install\"></a>\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8366877812/\" title=\"Speaker Install by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8366877812_1f465a8261_n.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Speaker Install\"></a>\r\n  <br/>\r\n  The speakers sit flush with the wall and really blend in.\r\n  </div>\r\n  \r\n  The only pain was running the speaker wire in the attic.  Since the speakers were on an exterior wall, I had to get \"intimate\" with the rafters and ceiling insulation to fish the wire out.  A 15-degree roof slope meant i was on my belly, balancing on the narrow edge of a 2x4 rafter, wedged all the way as far as I slither to reach the wires.  Once I got the wires fished up into the attic then down to where the amplifier is, it was all smooth sailing.\r\n  \r\n  Each speaker has 6 screw/clips that are designed so that as soon as you tighten the screw a small amount, a clip swings out to behind the drywall.  Tightening the screw sandwiches the drywall between the speaker bezel and the clips.  The speakers are held to the wall very firmly.  There was already ample insulation in the walls behind the speakers, which is a good thing for sound quality.\r\n  \r\n  I terminated the wires with a 4-post speaker wall plate and used banana plugs and some short lengths of speaker wire to go from the plate to the amp.\r\n  \r\n  <div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8365809853/\" title=\"Speaker Install by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8056/8365809853_091fc3a528_n.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Speaker Install\"></a></div>\r\n  \r\n  It all worked right out of the gate.  The biggest endorsement came from Arti via text message to me today.  She wrote to me \"Streaming spotify thru kitchen speakers... love it!\"\r\n  \r\n  The AirPort/Amp/Speaker combination could go into any room where we wanted music.  All of them can play independently or in unison, which would be great for a party.  Next up -- garage and back yard...\r\n\n:thumb_url: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8366877812_1f465a8261_q.jpg\n:title: Remote Speakers DIY\n"

My prior biggest run was 18 miles, and have never done any mid-week work.  This week I started running an hour each morning three days a week and plan on continuing that to build a solid base.  \r\n  \r\n  Getting sweaty in the morning has been awesome so far.  My outlook through the day is definitely more positive, and I have more energy in the evenings when I get home.  The only downside is that I'm sweating until the early afternoon.  But it's a good sweat!\r\n  \r\n  I plan on doing the week's big run on Sundays, and hope to build to 26 miles, alternating back to 16 mile distance once I pass that mark.  I can't carry enough water to do a full 26 miles, so I'll likely do it in back-to-back 13 mile distances, replenishing my water and food from the car in between.\r\n  \r\n  I've signed up for a half marathon race for February to get some experience with what to do in a race situation so that the 50K isn't the very first race.\r\n  \r\n  So that's about it.  Here's to the next 18 weeks!\r\n  \r\n  <iframe width='640' height='800' frameborder='0' src='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Av7-a2OfybnddENwQ1ljVnAwdTUwWDQySE9SNGs5RXc&single=true&gid=0&output=html&widget=true'></iframe>\r\n  \r\n  Have suggestions on how to make the plan better?

Allison, up and over Mission Peak, turned around and did it all in reverse.  It was just shy of 13 miles and took about 2h45m.  Total ascent was 3400 feet.\n  \n  At 8:30a, when I drove past the bank in Milpitas the sign said 33 degrees.  There were traces of frost/ice/snow once I got to around 2K feet.  Along the ridge the wind was really blowing, so I was glad to have worn gloves, but was wishing for something on my face/ears!\n  \n  All in all it was yet another unique time out there in the hills.

I brought 4 Honey Stinger gels, 4 salt capsules, 2 Whenever Bars, 2 packages of Honey Stinger Chews, and four small red boiled potatoes and salt.  The plan was to eat 2 gels and a bar on the way to Sunol then eat the potatoes and one bag of chews in Sunol, then the rest on the way back, with a salt capsule every 90 minutes or so.  \r\n  \r\n  On the way to Sunol I remembered that they had a few big Alhambra bottles near the picnic area for drinking water.  With this in mind, it was open season on the water I was carrying -- 100oz in the Camelbak and 20oz in a bottle.  This was going to be a good run if I didn't need to worry about how much water I was drinking, and hopefully gave me a taste of what the O50K will be like with its aid stations every 5 miles or so.\r\n  \r\n  The eating plan worked out really well, even though I forgot my baggie of salt for the potatoes.  I just popped open one of the salt capsules and sprinkled that on the potato...\r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8588457652/\" title=\"Ed Levin / Sunol / Ed Levin by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8378/8588457652_4d319e0bb8_z.jpg\" width=\"478\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Ed Levin / Sunol / Ed Levin\"></a>\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  Looks like cocaine, but it's salt.  I swear!  They really hit the spot.  I was really hungry when I sat down to eat them, and afterward I wasn't hungry until the very end of the run.\r\n  \r\n  The potatoes were the turn-around point.  I refilled my waters and headed out of Sunol back up the long hill up the back of Mission Peak.  The trail goes south past Mt. Allison, then to Monument Peak and down to Sandy Wool Lake in Ed Levin.  I stopped at the water spigot near the campsite behind Mission Peak to cool down my feet and knees and change my socks.  Very refreshing!\r\n  \r\n  I drank all the water and ate all the food on the way back.  Total fluids consumed were around 220oz.  It definitely helped to drink as much as I wanted -- I didn't feel as spent at the end of the run as I have in the past on shorter runs where I run out of water.\r\n  \r\n  This ended up being the farthest I ever hauled my self with my feet.  I feel pretty tired now, but not as \"crippled\" feeling as I've felt on shorter runs, likely thanks to the fluids, potatoes, and other food (about 1000 calories) that I ate along the way.\n:thumb_url: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8110/8588457394_14de1bd615_q.jpg\n:title: Ed Levin to Sunol and Back\n"

Not sure if it was the late 1pm start (after a 7:30a soccer game, mow the lawn, eat lunch), or \"just one of those days\" but I seriously considered calling it quits at mile 12, 15, and 17.  When I decided to press on at mile 17.0, I said to myself \"self, just run for a while then check your GPS app for your progress.\"  So I ran for what seemed like a whole mile, then checked the GPS -- Mile 17.2.  ARGH!  Anyhow, I'm starting to understand the meaning of the store name Zombie Runner now.  Just put it all aside and move your feet, buddy.\r\n  \r\n  I ended up going the distance.  5600 feet climb, 6 hours of moving.

Hit the trail at 6:45 with a plan to do the O50K course for 13-ish miles, then turn around and retrace my steps.\r\n  \r\n  It was a lovely morning, with cool air and a warm breeze that was a bellwether for the warm day that was to follow.  My plan was to take it really easy so that I could cover the full distance without falling apart.  \r\n  \r\n  The first 4.5 miles up Mission Peak were an exercise in restraint, but I kept telling myself that it was all for the best.  Got to the top in 1:20 and felt like I hadn't done anything, so mission accomplished there.\r\n  \r\n  As I was turning onto the trail that leads down to Sunol, I spotted another runner with a hydration vest.  Likely another O50K crazy, so I chatted him up.  Ends up he's run the race before, and has now moved on to 100 milers.  Super nice guy, we chatted all the way down to Sunol where he was going to turn around.\r\n  \r\n  After filling up our water and parting ways, I continued on the O50K trail.  It was still springtime-beautiful out there, with many wildflowers blooming and the grass green for the most part.  Over the Rock Scramble, then through the gate to the Backpack Area and its steep climb (23% grade).  I got to the other end of the Backpack Area, and decided this is where I'd turn around.  My GPS said 14.0 miles at that point.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8670411252/\" title=\"Last Long Training Run by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8125/8670411252_782ddd1d47_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Last Long Training Run\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  Back down to Sunol, refilled water again, and up the long steady climb back to Mission Peak.  Up to about mile 23 I was feeling awesome -- strong legs and clear head.  That feeling mostly continued to the end.  My measure of mental clarity is whether I will pick up litter on the trail -- that continued all the way to the end of the run, and I kept a reasonable running pace to the end too.  Back down the steep slopes of Mission Peak and another half mile to the car, and here we are.\r\n  \r\n  Stats: 27.8mi, 7300ft climb, 1800 calories food, 300oz water, 3lbs net loss bodyweight.\r\n  \r\n  Here's what 1800 calories looks like: (yep, I'm a huge fan of Honey Stinger products!)<center>\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8669308249/\" title=\"1800 Calories by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8105/8669308249_bd08caf855.jpg\" width=\"374\" height=\"500\" alt=\"1800 Calories\"></a></center>\r\n  \r\n  I'm pretty sure these legs have another 3 miles in them for the big race on May 19!\r\n  \r\n  <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/activities/49998843/embed/3518ed28fe01d41ab18021c4e786f331cd707128'></iframe>\n:thumb_url: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8105/8669308249_bd08caf855_q.jpg\n:title: Last Long Run Before O50K\n"

Today I chose to start from Ohlone and run up and over Mission Peak then over to the bench at Mt. Allison.  It was a total of 9.1 miles with a 2520 foot climb.\r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/activities/52532059/embed/3810b5dd486c5695393485e2dba4b16c0c35f1da'></iframe>\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  The route I chose was to go up \"Buttburner Hill\", which you can get to if you take a hard right turn after first gate after the initial long climb from the Ohlone parking lot.  Buttburner Hill is 0.6 miles long and gains 821 feet (27.5% grade).  There is 0.2 mile section that climbs almost 500 feet -- a 40% grade!  It's a great workout for the quads and achilles.\r\n  \r\n  From there, the route meets up with the normal Ohlone trail after the steep part of that trail, then continues up the peak.\r\n  \r\n  This was the first time I ran all the way up the last big climb of Mission Peak -- Cardiac Hill as Arti calls it.  It was pretty tough toward the end just before the peak, but my legs were feeling great today so I pushed through it.\r\n  \r\n  Over the peak, then Mt. Allison is a couple more miles of easy running.  The way back from Mt. Allison yields one of my favorite views of Mission Peak...\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8710994473/\" title=\"Ohlone steep to Mt Allison by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8413/8710994473_10e3a0cdce_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Ohlone steep to Mt Allison\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  I chose to run on the trail behind the Peak to go back to Ohlone and encountered two Gopher Snakes.  One was reallllly long (5 feet I'd guess)...\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8710994779/\" title=\"Ohlone steep to Mt Allison by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8125/8710994779_67e025282f_z.jpg\" width=\"478\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Ohlone steep to Mt Allison\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8712119814/\" title=\"Ohlone steep to Mt Allison by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8393/8712119814_24628a7b9f_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Ohlone steep to Mt Allison\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  ... and one was reallllly tiny (less than a foot)...\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8712120172/\" title=\"Ohlone steep to Mt Allison by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8267/8712120172_a3a6be76d8_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Ohlone steep to Mt Allison\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  That makes 4 snakes on the last 3 runs.  It's snake season!\r\n  \r\n  All in all, it was a super fun run.  With longer runs I have to hold back on the steep stuff to conserve energy, so being able to really give it my all on the steep stuff is really gratifying.  Hopefully it serves to build up climbing strength that will help on O50K.\n:thumb_url: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8413/8710994473_10e3a0cdce_q.jpg\n:title: Ohlone Steep Training\n"

Here they are:\r\n  <dl class=\"running_entry\">\r\n    <dt>Foam Roller + Stretch Every Day</dt>\r\n    <dd>The foam roller is a kind of self-massage that uses your body weight to bear down on your muscles.  I'm not sure why or how it works, but there is no doubt that it does work to make tired muscles feel fresh, and to make tight muscles looser.  Tight muscles can lead to pain and injury -- my own knee injury in February was due to an overly tight sartorious muscle (goes from your hip to the inside of your knee).  Since foam rolling every day, no problems.  This <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Black-High-Density-Foam-Rollers/dp/B0040NJOA0\">6x36 inch high density model</a> is my favorite.  The high density foam is best to work out tight muscles, and the 36\" length means you have lots of space to work on.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8724032635/\" title=\"Foam Roller and Stretch by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7370/8724032635_0ea10ca93f_m.jpg\" width=\"164\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Foam Roller and Stretch\" class=\"float_right\"></a>My routine is to get up on one side on the roller and roll my outer thighs (IT band) first, then outer quad, middle quad, and as best as I can do inner quad.  I'll then shift to lower legs and roll from my ankle to knee, hitting the outer, middle, and inner achilles and calves.  Hamstrings are next, rolling ouside, middle, and inside, then up my glutes.  Then I'll turn on my belly and straddle one end of the roller to roll my inner thigh down to my inner quads and over the inside of my knee.  This is the medial quad and sartorious muscle that was responsible for my injury in February.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8724032783/\" title=\"Foam Roller and Stretch by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/8724032783_d14c9697b5_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"179\" alt=\"Foam Roller and Stretch\" class=\"float_left\"></a>For stretching, I use the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stretch-Out-Strap-New-Instructional-booklet/dp/B00065X222/ref=pd_bxgy_hpc_img_z\">Stretch Out Strap</a> which is a 6 foot long nylon strap with loops over its length.  I'll lay on my back and hook my foot through one end loop, then hold on to a middle loop and pull my foot up to stretch out my calves and hamstrings, first with my knee straight, then bent (you can feel it in a different place in your hamstrings both ways).  With my toe still through the loop, I'll bring my foot out to the side (inner thigh stretch) then across my body (glutes and outer hamstrings).  Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds.  I'll then bend my knee and pull my foot inward and toward my body which is a great glute stretch.\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>Drink, Drink, Drink (and Salt)</dt>\r\n  <dd>There are few things you can do to spoil a great run more than not drinking enough.  My best runs have been those where I know I have enough water to drink to my heart's content.  Don't short change your day by skimping on the hydration.\r\n  \r\n  <img src=\"/omega_blue.jpg\" class=\"float_right\"/>I know some runners who don't need much water, but I know I need a LOT of water.  My current formula is to bring 10oz per mile if I'm going for more than an hour.  My usual hydration solution is to stuff a 100oz Camelbak bladder into this <a href=\"http://www.zombierunner.com/store/brands/ultraspire/packs/product3998.html\">UltrAspire hydration vest</a>.  The vest comes with a 70oz bladder, so I'll bring that instead if I can refill or finish after 7-8 miles.\r\n  \r\n  <img src=\"/saltstick_caps_bottle.jpg\" class=\"float_left\"/>If I'm going for more than a couple hours, I'll take a salt capsule (<a href=\"http://www.zombierunner.com/store/product351.html\">SaltStick Electrolyte Capsules</a>) every 90 minutes or so.  Your body won't absorb water if it would drop your salinity too far -- so it's possible to dehydrate by drinking only clear water!  Electrolyte drinks in large quantity don't have enough sodium or other minerals to actually preserve your sodium balance, so clear water and salt capsules are the way to go.  Even better -- the UltrAspire pack has a pocket dedicated to  this use.  \r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>Nutrition on the Move</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n  Running up and down hills burns a LOT of calories compared with running on flat ground or cycling.  Similar to dehydration, it sucks to be out on the trail hungry -- I've BTDT and it can start to get ugly.  I've learned to bring a little extra food every time I go for a run.\r\n  \r\n  As for what to eat out there, here are some of my favorites:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>Honey Stinger Gels (really just pure honey with some extra vitamins - 120 calories)</li>\r\n  <li>Honey Stinger Chews (all the flavors are so tasty -- the Lime-Aide is my ranking favorite with its subtle boost of caffeine from white tea, about 1/2 cup of coffee worth - 160 calories, 32mg caffeine)</li>\r\n  <li>Honey Stinger Coconut Almond Pro bar (10g of protein in each bar, and super delicious - 190 calories)</li>\r\n  <li>Simple Squares (280 calories in a very tasty, compact form)</li>\r\n  <li>Boiled Potatoes (open a salt capsule and sprinkle on for oh-so-deliciousness midway through a long run)</li>\r\n  <li>Fruit (keep next to your icy hydration bladder for a midrun reward)</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  I'll usually eat something every 45 minutes or so.  Before a long run, I'll make a plan for exactly what I'll eat when, usually it goes gel-chews-bar/square/potato-gel-chews-bar/square/potato-etc...\r\n  \r\n  For a big training run, I ate a total of 1800 calories over the course of 7 hours.  That was pretty much right on for me, since I wasn't starving when I was done.\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>Size Up!</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n  <img src=\"/sense_ultra_racing_red_black_top.jpg\" class=\"float_right\"/>This one is simple.  After dealing with lots of blisters while hiking, I learned that your feet grow when you're on them a lot.  I'm normally an 11.5 in \"everyday\" shoes.  For running shoes, I'll go up to a 12 or even 13 depending on the shoe.  My index toe is longer than my big toe, so I've learned to use that toe to assess shoe length.  Most shoes for ultrarunning run large, so there is less need to size up.  I've learned to leave an inch at the front for my poor toesies.\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>Make Friends Who Have Done This Before</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n  I'm lucky that I work close to <a href=\"http://www.zombierunner.com/\">ZombieRunner</a> -- an ultrarunning store in Palo Alto, CA.  I go there pretty much every day for my daily Zombie Chai (an experience in a cup that everyone should try), and so have gotten to know several of the people who work there.  Don and Gillian are the owners and avid ultrarunners and are always happy to give advice, as are their employees.  They care deeply about the quality of the products they carry, so it's just a great resource all around.\r\n  \r\n  I've also gotten to know a few people I've met out on the trails.  Most of them are way farther along in the world of running than I am, and so they're great to get advice, ideas, and encouragement from.  For example, check out <a href=\"http://beultra.com/wordpress/\">Beat Jegerlehner's running blog</a> to be humbled or inspired -- he finished the Iditarod Trail Invitational 1000 mile race this year in 28 days, and has finished multiple 200+ mile races in the French and Swiss Alps.  My little 50K is nothing!\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>Have a Supportive Spouse</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n  Ok, well you will either have this or not.  But it really helps to have a partner who thinks that you spending 7 hours out on the trail on a Sunday practicing for a crazy race is a good idea.  Thanks Arti!\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>Make a Plan and Measure Your Runs</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n  I almost didn't put this in, because I think I must take data for granted.  But perhaps I'm an outlier there?  Anyhow, I have found it tremendously useful to record GPS tracks of every run I do.  When I was doing more hiking, I used an app called Gaia GPS on my iPhone to do that.  Its strength is in its ability to download map data locally to the phone, including USGS Topographic maps, which is essential for someone exploring unfamiliar terrain without a cellular data signal.  \r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8724184805/\" title=\"Strava Screenshot by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7317/8724184805_ff186b9040_n.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"280\" alt=\"Strava Screenshot\" class=\"float_left\"></a>Since I've been running on familiar ground, I have really fell in love with an app called <a href=\"http://www.strava.com/\">Strava</a>.  What sets Strava apart is the social/competitive nature of the product.  The iPhone app is pretty standard, but once you upload the GPS data to their site, you can compare whole runs and segments of runs with other people who have covered the same ground.  It's a great way to get perspective and feel encouraged that it's always possible to go faster.\r\n  \r\n  For the Ohlone 50K race, I scoured the internet for as many 50K plans as I could find.  I combined them into one that seemed good to me, then I showed it to a few people who had done 50Ks themselves.  After tuning the plan with their good advice, I ended up with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av7-a2OfybnddENwQ1ljVnAwdTUwWDQySE9SNGs5RXc#gid=0\">this plan</a>.\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>Enjoy the View!</dt>\r\n  <dd>If it's not fun and awesome, then don't bother -- find something else you love.  For me, having time outside in the quiet openness with the plants and animals, improving myself, and finding new limits is the draw.  Getting to the top of a peak and enjoying the view unique to that day is a big motivator.  Every run is different, and in each one there is something new to do or see.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8724032411/\" title=\"Bike to Work Day Run by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7307/8724032411_bd14555449_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Bike to Work Day Run\"></a>\r\n\n:excerpt: Since getting serious about running at the end of 2012 in preparation for the Ohlone Wilderness 50K, I've learned a few things about body maintenance, drinking, eating, and other things running-related.\n:thumb_url: http://steinkamp.us/run_thumb.png\n:title: \"Trail Running: What I've Learned So Far\"\n"

My plan was to do the O50K climb up Mission Peak, but turn right at the top of the ridge and visit Mt. Allison before heading back over and down Mission Peak.  9.7 miles, 2750ft climb, 2h05m.\r\n  \r\n  There were a few spaces in the Stanford Ave parking lot when I got there at 8am -- I guess the chilly, foggy morning scared a lot of people away.  Or maybe the active people were out riding their bikes to work.  \r\n  \r\n  Anyhow, it seemed like a good day for a new challenge, so I decided to run up the trail until the Peak Meadow Trail cutover to Horse Heaven.  This yielded my fastest ascent to that spot yet -- 1.5 miles / 1050ft climb in 21m51s.  That's about a minute and a half faster than I've done it before, with a mix of running and walking.  I took it easy across the Peak Meadow Trail, then finished the ascent to the top of the ridge.  I ran from there until the end -- to the bench at Mt. Allison, back down, up and over Mission Peak, and down to the parking lot.  The pace was good enough to be my fastest yet from the peak to the parking lot -- 26 minutes.  The last mile down was at an 8:01 pace, and my quads and calves were feeling it! (in a good way)\r\n  \r\n  <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/activities/53280591/embed/9474f7baab2806ffa513a155c146024a88e97d84'></iframe>\r\n  \r\n  The \"extra mile\" trail is getting a bit overgrown.

  data: "--- \n:excerpt: Last October I decided to run the Ohlone Wilderness Trail 50K.  After 6 months of training covering 435 miles and climbing more than 80,000 feet, the race is now in the bag.\n:content: |-\n  Last October I decided to run the <a href=\"http://ohlone50k.com/\">Ohlone Wilderness Trail 50K</a>.  Leading up to that decision was a few years of hiking in the East Bay hills, a newfound enjoyment in running, and daily trips to Zombie Runner where I learned about the race.\r\n  \r\n  After 6 months of training covering 435 miles and climbing more than 80,000 feet, the race is now in the bag.\r\n  \r\n  <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/activities/55203238/embed/226f1f170031f1ef95cd00f83dd0d98d35447fa7'></iframe>\r\n  \r\n  It wasn't all so easy though.  In February I got over-exuberant with my training and ended up with a knee injury that took me off the trails for two weeks.  The guys at <a href=\"http://www.scoreclinic.com/\">Score Clinic</a> got me back out there though.  Armed with a better plan, and a healthy respect for caring for my muscles and joints I got back in the training groove again.  Building up from 12 mile runs to a 28 mile run didn't end up being as difficult as it seemed when first laying out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av7-a2OfybnddENwQ1ljVnAwdTUwWDQySE9SNGs5RXc\">the plan</a>.  Taking deliberate, small increases in the training runs is the key, as is daily foam-rolling and stretching and building knowledge of what my body needs nutrition- and hydration-wise when \"out there\" for hours at a time.\r\n  \r\n  After my last long training run I was feeling great.  A couple weeks after that run, I was well in the taper portion of the plan, and my legs felt super energized.  They were like springs coiled up, ready to explode.  I let that feeling get the best of me by going for an <a href=\"http://app.strava.com/activities/53280591\">overly intense 10 miler on Mission Peak and Mt. Allison</a> where I set several personal bests -- but afterward I started to get some knee pain again.\r\n  \r\n  My plan called for a <a href=\"http://app.strava.com/activities/53686007\">16 mile heat training run</a> two days later -- a week before the race -- which turned into a hot mess.  I developed blisters on my feet from the new, different, racier shoes than what I had trained in and significant knee pain running on slight downhill grades.  After 20 weeks of training, I had totally screwed it up in the final week!\r\n  \r\n  A visit to Dr. Tomo at Score on Monday had my knee feeling pretty good.  I did a <a href=\"http://app.strava.com/activities/54876017\">6mi checkout run</a> the day before the race, and the knee pain returned in a fairly severe way.  Back to Score for an emergency visit with Dr. Brandon, who hooked me up with a light ART release, a chiropractic adjustment to my spine and ankles, and some rock tape to support the over-tight aductor muscles that were causing the pain.  His sendoff of \"well, good luck!\" made me think tomorrow's race would be a crap shoot.\r\n  \r\n  I was hemming and hawing to Arti the night before about how I thought the race would be a disaster.  She told me not to worry about it -- athletes run with pain all the time.  This kind of pain wasn't something that would be a long term injury, so she said just run with it Sunday and deal with it Monday.  Well, OK!\r\n  \r\n  She and Naomi dropped me off at the Mission Peak trailhead at 7:15a on Sunday.  Arti gave me another encouraging pep talk in the parking lot, then I was off to pick up my number bib and wait for the 8:00a start.\r\n  \r\n  Most runners will drive to the race finish at Lake Del Valle early in the morning and hop on one of a few busses booked by the race organizers to transport them to Mission Peak.  The busses arrived at around 7:30, and the lot really started filling up with crazy runners.  I hadn't ever seen so many people in one place who look like they could kick a mountain's ass -- it was great!\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755127403/\" title=\"Race Start by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7431/8755127403_9820ee5593_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Race Start\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  At the start of the race, most people took off running.  \r\n  \r\n  <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ykoD2gpARto?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n  \r\n  Zombie Don had been pounding the race strategy into my head for months -- walk up the Peak, nice and easy down to Sunol.  I felt like I was dead last on the initial climb, but I knew this was how I was going to be able to finish the race.  \r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755127689/\" title=\"Team DFL by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8259/8755127689_7daacffc69_n.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Team DFL\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8756248282/\" title=\"Bog Crossing by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7352/8756248282_36e604c2a2_n.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Bog Crossing\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  I ended up passing a few people on the steep slopes of Mission Peak, but for the most part the race was way out in front of me.  Despite feeling like I was going tortoise-slow up the Peak, it ended up being my 2nd fastest time ever on the extra-mile O50K route to the top (1h12m @ 4.1mi).  The energy of the race is a real factor.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755128365/\" title=\"Peak View by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8273/8755128365_5abdaf31f4_n.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Peak View\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755128693/\" title=\"At the Peak by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8557/8755128693_295ea8ed6a.jpg\" width=\"390\" height=\"320\" alt=\"At the Peak\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  We went over the top of the peak (2500ft), then down the relatively gentle descent to Sunol.  I took it really easy on this part, since this was where my knee was giving me trouble the prior weekend.  \r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755129043/\" title=\"Starting the Run Down to Sunol by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2868/8755129043_b2d8243f37_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Starting the Run Down to Sunol\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  It felt a bit tight, but never very painful.  I stuck with a slow pace and short strides and it stayed just fine.  At about mile 8 I realized that the race was totally possible.  A euphoric feeling swept through me, and I let out a few yelps in celebration.\r\n  \r\n  There were aid stations every 4-5 miles, which was great.  In my practice runs I'd go 9-15 miles between refilling my water, so being able to carry less water and chat with the helpful and friendly folks at the aid stations was nice.  They also had a great selection of potatoes, pb&j sandwiches, candy, gels, etc.  I had brought all my food for the most part, but I did grab a few potatoes and pb&j along the way.\r\n  \r\n  Here are pictures of all but one aid station.  I forgot to get a picture of the nice people manning the Goat Rock station.  Next time!\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755129441/\" title=\"Laurel Aid Station (mi 5.4) by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/8755129441_b603bdae62_m.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Laurel Aid Station (mi 5.4)\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755130247/\" title=\"Laurel Aid Station (mi 5.4) by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2838/8755130247_aaa4129061_m.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Laurel Aid Station (mi 5.4)\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8756250812/\" title=\"Sunol Aid Station (mi 9.1) by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3788/8756250812_d1680d7740_m.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Sunol Aid Station (mi 9.1)\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755130937/\" title=\"Backpack Aid Station in Sight (mi 12.5) by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8397/8755130937_5fb929dccd_m.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Backpack Aid Station in Sight (mi 12.5)\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755131965/\" title=\"Maggie's Half-Acre Aid Station (mi 19.7) by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7352/8755131965_7abc127329_m.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Maggie's Half-Acre Aid Station (mi 19.7)\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755132671/\" title=\"Schlieper Rock Aid Station (mi 25.6) by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7306/8755132671_bb4990ca89_m.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Schlieper Rock Aid Station (mi 25.6)\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8756253808/\" title=\"Stromer Spring Aid Station (mi 29.0) by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8274/8756253808_b4d2555585_m.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Stromer Spring Aid Station (mi 29.0)\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  With the long race and all of the aid stations to keep track of, this mile-by-mile printout was handy to stay on top of my nutrition, water, and salt/electrolytes.  I ended up eating all the food, but only taking 4 salt capsules.  I think the heat training from the prior weekend helped out there.  Acclimation to heat doesn't reduce the quantity of sweat, but it does decrease the amount of salt in a person's sweat -- salt that needs to be replenished.  I had my 60oz hydration bladder, and filled it up at every aid station.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8758312480/\" title=\"Mile-by-mile Plan by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5460/8758312480_b8207ee881_m.jpg\" width=\"179\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Mile-by-mile Plan\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  At Sunol (mile 9, 400ft), things were all warmed up, and it was time for the long climb to Rose Peak.  All the way up, I'd pass and get passed by pretty much the same people.  Overall we were evenly matched on pace, but some people are faster on the downhill sections, and some faster on uphill.  My strength is in the climbs, so I'd usually catch people on the steep uphills.  Everyone around was very friendly -- much more camaraderie than competition.\r\n  \r\n  The course goes up and over Rose Peak, then loops around on itself.  There were a couple of people at the peak handing out bracelets that showed that we didn't cut the loop.  Everything was still feeling great at the top of Rose Peak (mile 19, 3800ft) and now I really knew that I'd be able to finish the race.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8756251598/\" title=\"Rose Peak by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7432/8756251598_6d4255672c_n.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Rose Peak\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8756251978/\" title=\"Back of Rose Peak by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/8756251978_d4252ca9a3.jpg\" width=\"390\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Back of Rose Peak\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  From mile 20 to 27 I ran and chatted with another first-timer Steve.  We had a lot to talk about and a similar pace so it worked out.  He had run in several races before, but nothing this long.  We ran through the Tahoe-like sections a few miles after Rose Peak, with the heat, red dust, and smell of pine trees.  The terrain changed to a lush poison oak forest, with steep shaded single track slopes.  There was then a pretty good uphill climb at Stewart's Camp / Murietta Falls, a big descent, then another steep uphill at William's Gulch.  Steve and I kept each others' spirits up in this tough, hot, steep section.\r\n  \r\n  At Rocky Ridge (mile 27, 2400ft), I stopped to stretch, and Steve continued.  He had been feeling some pain in his knee, but it ended up not stopping him.  Here were the first views of Lake Del Valle (750ft), so now I had more of a sense of how much was left.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8756253220/\" title=\"Rocky Ridge by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8416/8756253220_0ee35de0c2_n.jpg\" width=\"310\" height=\"239\" alt=\"Rocky Ridge\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755133301/\" title=\"Lake Del Valle finally shows itself. by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2886/8755133301_e508b98c9d_n.jpg\" width=\"310\" height=\"239\" alt=\"Lake Del Valle finally shows itself.\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8756254130/\" title=\"Better Lake View by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2881/8756254130_e2a5cab95a_n.jpg\" width=\"310\" height=\"239\" alt=\"Better Lake View\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  I ran the last steep downhill starting at around mile 29, then started to hear the sounds of the finish line.  This was really really encouraging.  A couple of people walking up the hill pointed at the next crest, and told me \"that's the last hill, from there it's just a half mile easy downhill\".  Oh yes!  I can do this!!!\r\n  \r\n  The sound of the finish line got louder and louder.  The pain in my feet and legs totally disappeared.  I really wanted to get to that finish line!  I kicked up my pace, knowing that I didn't need to conserve any more.  As I dropped out of the trees, I saw Arti and the girls get up and run along the finish chute.  The girls were holding up a sign they had made that said \"GO DADA GO\".  I was in full sprint, wearing a huge smile, tears welling up, and the finish line dead ahead.\r\n  \r\n  I crossed the line after 8h15m, 31 miles, and 8500ft of climbing.\r\n  \r\n  Larry England the race director was there congratulating each finisher.  It's clear he loves this race.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8756254406/\" title=\"Finisher by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/8756254406_501ee6843e_n.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"265\" alt=\"Finisher\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8756254772/\" title=\"Me and Chunk by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8419/8756254772_f5765b0c23_n.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"265\" alt=\"Me and Chunk\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8756255028/\" title=\"Fan Club by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3674/8756255028_9b4f4df6b8_n.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"265\" alt=\"Fan Club\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  Arti brought a blanket, flip-flops, some warm raviolis, and other snacks with her and the girls.  We spent the next 45 minutes relaxing on the soft grass and warm sun, cheering on the rest of the people who were finishing the race.\r\n  \r\n  I've never invested this much time and energy into anything before in my life.  It's been a great lesson in planning, learning, and understanding what a person is capable of.  I'm not sure what will come next, but I'm certainly not finished running.\r\n  \r\n  Results have been <a href=\"http://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=17151\">posted</a>!  119th place!\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8755135133/\" title=\"The spoils. by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2874/8755135133_f240982f97_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"The spoils.\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Bursting with gratitude for...</h3>\r\n  <strong>Arti</strong> -- So encouraging, so patient, so practical, and so accommodating of my nutty training regimin.

Allison\n:description: |-\n  For several months, my friend and riding buddy Sean and I have been talking about doing a \"double dip\".  The idea is to do a big climb on our bikes, ride down, then run up and down the same hill.\r\n  \r\n  We did that a few weeks back up and down Mission Peak, and it was a blast.  \r\n  \r\n  I decided that today was another good Double Dip opportunity.  We didn't have much planned, and Arti and I are signed up for a sprint tri next week, so it's good to get some conditioning in for that.\r\n  \r\n  So today I rode from Ohlone College to Mt. Allison and back, put the bike in the car, then did the same thing on foot.\r\n  \r\n  The weather was great -- warm with a cool breeze.  It's hard to ask for a better way to spend a Sunday!\r\n  \r\n  <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/activities/67043086/embed/343eac84dc25497b50af1e5c08bee65b65c64d3a'></iframe>\r\n  \r\n  <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/activities/67084059/embed/e846a0132cf995612a638deae21896fbd4593503'></iframe>\n:photos: \n- :pub_date: 2013-07-14 09:14:28\n  :title: IMG_7744\n  :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7368/9287533306_acde3fa0b8_s.jpg\n  :id: \"9287533306\"\n- :pub_date: 2013-07-14 11:07:11\n  :title: IMG_7745\n  :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7432/9284759041_d5158b7a5c_s.jpg\n  :id: \"9284759041\"\n- :pub_date: 2013-07-14 11:07:39\n  :title: IMG_7747\n  :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5340/9284759951_a19f861357_s.jpg\n  :id: \"9284759951\"\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5340/9284759951_a19f861357_m.jpg\n:id: \"72157634634995971\"\n:num_photos: 3\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  It all started in May.  Actually, it all started 11 years ago when Arti and I signed up for the 15th annual Tri For Fun in Pleasanton at Shadow Cliffs park.  Swimming, biking, and running were all things that I did *not* do, but we thought this would be fun.  Well, Arti did at least.\r\n  \r\n  We spent the next several months preparing for this race.  There was a 400 yard swim, 11 mile bike ride, and 3.1 mile run.  We would go to the community pool in Mountain View two or three times a week and swim a couple of thousand yards.  We would run around our neighborhood for 30-60 minutes at a time which was severely unsavory for me at the time.  We'd ride our bikes occasionally, but really ... who needs to train to ride a bike?\r\n  \r\n  When the time came to do the 2002 Tri, we nailed the swim, cruised on the bikes, and hobbled around the course on the run.  Well, Arti pranced around on the run since she has the stamina of Half Dome.\r\n  \r\n  It was indeed a fun time, but we didn't really get the itch to do it again.  So time passed.\r\n  \r\n  This year, I overheard a few friends (David M, David F, Sarah J) at work talking about doing a triathlon.  It turns out they were talking about the same one Arti and I did 11 years back!  This seemed like an intriguing adventure, so I mentioned it to Arti and she signed us up that night.  Both of us are in way better physical condition than we were 11 years ago, so it seemed like actual fun to do this with some friends.\r\n  \r\n  Arti has been teaching cycling and group fitness amid occasional runs and bike outings.  I've been running 20-30 miles per week and biking 50-150 miles per week, so we were so ready for this.  Oh yeah -- there is a swimming part right?  We made one trip to a lap pool a month before the race and swam 600 yards or so.  So.... swimming is pretty tough!  But we're in great shape, right?\r\n  \r\n  I had been joking with the youngest of the three friends (David M, 23) about how I was going to clean his clock in the race.  He swam competitively in college, but only recently picked up biking and running.  Old man stamina is no match for young man aggression, isn't it?\r\n  \r\n  The night before the race, we packed up the car and drove to stay at Kanta's house in Pleasanton.  David M also joined us there.  David F and Diego stayed in a nearby hotel.  Unfortunately Sarah J bumped her head pretty hard a couple weeks prior and wasn't able to do the tri this time, but she promised to be there to root us on.\r\n  \r\n  We got up at 5am Saturday to get ready for the event.  After a quick breakfast, we hopped on our bikes for the 4 mile ride to Shadow Cliffs.  This was a really nice start to the day, since we could get moving a bit.  David F and Diego passed us in their car just outside the park entrance, so it was great timing.  We claimed a spot in the transition area and hung out until things got rolling.\r\n  \r\n  There were three heats of starts -- men, women, and kids+older folks.  This means that I was going to start with both Davids, but Arti would be in the next heat.  After some instructions and a pep talk from the race organizer, we were off splashing into the lake to swim out 120 yards or so to the first buoy.  I knew I should take it really easy since I didn't practice too much and I wasn't too experienced swimming in close quarters to other folks.  No problem -- I'll just hang back and catch David M on the bike.\r\n  \r\n  At the first buoy, I was pretty winded.  Swimming is kind of like running -- if you don't work up to it, it's really hard!  I was breathing pretty much every stroke.  Whenever I'd run into someone I'd stop and lose all my momentum.  After rounding the corner to head for the second buoy I started having some panicky thoughts.  This was really surprising to me -- we were surrounded by 20 or so lifeguards on surfboards, so there wasn't any real danger, but I kept thinking about what would happen if I just couldn't continue.  I turned over on my back a couple times to catch my breath, then continued on with the swim to the second buoy.  I remember once on my back I just stared up at the sky and wondered what the heck I got myself into.  \"Dark Moments\".  Ends up David F and Arti both did the same thing in roughly the same place, ha!  The lifeguards probably are used to this kind of nonsense :-).\r\n  \r\n  After rounding the second buoy, it was time to swim back to shore.  I probably did half of this stretch on my back.  \"You should have practiced swimming a LOT more you knucklehead\", I kept telling myself in a demonstration of awesome self-encouragement.\r\n  \r\n  Finally I got so where I could touch bottom in the lake again and so I transitioned from \"splash and flail in the water\" to \"run the heck out of this damn lake\" and headed for my trusty bike.  I think I was in the water for 12 or 15 minutes.  Super David M finished the swim in 6m17s -- incredible!  As I left the water, Sarah J was there with a great sign -- \"Go Zack! Smoke the 20-something!\".  She shouted that David M was 4 minutes ahead.  I wasn't sure if I could get him on the bike, but I had hope.\r\n  \r\n  <center><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9334973311/\" title=\"Out of the Water by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5519/9334973311_3925d3d974_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" alt=\"Out of the Water\"></a></center>\r\n  \r\n  The bike route was truncated a bit from prior years due to some construction, so it ended up being less than 9 miles.  Knowing this, I set in full speed ahead sprint power mode.  I was huffing and puffing the whole time on my mountain bike with knobby-tires, but I managed to pass a few guys on full carbon special aero tri bikes, especially going up hills.\r\n  \r\n  <center><iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/activities/68504894/embed/3d3d1b35f409083adcc47b44e2a3b5ca21b50d02'></iframe></center>\r\n  \r\n  Back to the transition area, I ditched my bike and helmet and took off for the final run.  Again Sarah J was at the transition area and told me that David M was only a minute and a half ahead.  \"Oh yes -- I think I can get him\", I thought.\r\n  \r\n  I took off at a pace that felt like 9 or 10 minutes per mile.  Ends up it was right at 8 minutes/mile.  About halfway though the course, I spotted David M's green shoes.  He was walking up a hill!  This was my chance.  I caught up to him and gave him a big high five, and suggested that we run together.  And so we did.  He stepped it up given the fresh challenge, and we ran together all the way to the end.  The course looped back on itself three times, so we got to say hi to David F and then to Arti as we were making our way through.\r\n  \r\n  <center><iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/activities/68505407/embed/10177768a25738b82b03eafdaaab0b77b8b80e57'></iframe></center>\r\n  \r\n  The final chute was diabolically long, but we kicked it up and did 6:30 pace in the last few hundred yards.  We ended up with a 1h5m total time.  It was great fun to finish together.  We grabbed some drinks and snacks at the finish then went to find Sarah J.  She had flowers for us and a cardboard cut-out gold medal for me.  We had been joking about that earlier in the week.  That was great, Sarah -- thanks so much!\r\n  \r\n  <center><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9337761700/\" title=\"Home Stretch by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2825/9337761700_7dc842a7ed_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"496\" alt=\"Home Stretch\"></a></center>\r\n  \r\n  I decided to backtrack on the course to find Arti to finish with her.  I saw David F along the way and shouted some random encouragement his way -- he was running really strong when I saw him.  I got to Arti as she was coming down the last hill before the long finishing chute, and we ran together to the end.  She was hauling -- it was challenging for me to keep up with her ;-).\r\n  \r\n  <center><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9334974085/\" title=\"Finishing With Arti by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7402/9334974085_7e6d92a3d3_z.jpg\" width=\"616\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Finishing With Arti\"></a></center>\r\n  \r\n  The triumphant finishers:\r\n  <center>\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9337760804/\" title=\"Tri Finishers by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5499/9337760804_1f8aef8f5f_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"425\" alt=\"Tri Finishers\"></a>\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  After a bit of hanging out at the park, we all headed back to Kanta's house for a post-race brunch (chole, poories, and the best pickled mango ever).  We stayed for a couple of hours enjoying the nice weather and company, then headed home.\r\n  \r\n  When is the next tri, guys?\n:excerpt: \"\"\n:thumb_url: http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7402/9334974085_7e6d92a3d3_q.jpg\n:title: Tri For Fun - Pleasanton 2013 Recap\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  After we got home from the Pleasanton Tri For Fun, I was excited to tear into my weekend bike project.  I had gotten a new driveline (gears, cranks, shifters, chain etc) for my bike to upgrade what came on the bike originally.  I had been planning it out all week, and Saturday was the day that I could execute the plan.\r\n  \r\n  A couple of hours into the project, I was working at the bench in the garage when I heard the familiar thrum of a hummingbird nearby.  Sure enough, a little grey and green hummingbird was in the garage with me.  It seemed disoriented, flitting around the rafters and lights somewhat haphazardly.  I tried to shoo it outside, but it's a hummingbird -- no way a person can keep up with one of those little guys.  So I continued working on my project, disassembling the bike nearly completely, cleaning stuff up, and installing the new parts.  The hummingbird would occasionally chirp and whiz by my head as I was working.\r\n  \r\n  I finished the project in the afternoon, and left the garage door open hoping my friend would fly out, back to his tree or bush or wherever he normally stayed.  I checked back at night, and he was still there!  So I left the garage open for a couple of more hours, turning off all the lights so that perhaps he would be attracted to the light outside.\r\n  \r\n  I checked again before bed, and didn't see or hear him in there.  I was glad that it seemed he had made his way out, so I shut the garage door and turned in for the night.\r\n  \r\n  In the morning I wanted to tinker a bit on the bike, so I went back to the garage and opened it.  My buddy was still in there, but flying even more erratically.  I grabbed a broom to try to get him to go outside.  No dice.  He ran into a little nut and bolt storage thing on the wall and kind of tumbled down and collected himself on the edge of a case of motor oil.\r\n  \r\n  <center><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9338543353/\" title=\"Hummingbird by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3734/9338543353_df4468d06e_z.jpg\" width=\"478\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Hummingbird\"></a></center>\r\n  \r\n  Well, here was the opportunity to trap him and take him outside.  I found a styrofoam container and shooed him in there.  This time he didn't put up much of a fight and he just sat in there, not trying to fly away.\r\n  \r\n  <center><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9338543729/\" title=\"Hummingbird by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2818/9338543729_15a8e07da9_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Hummingbird\"></a></center>\r\n  \r\n  The girls got involved at this point and were really curious about the hummingbird.  They had never seen one so close before, and wanted to hold it.  Naomi even wondered aloud if she could dress him up!\r\n  \r\n  We took him out of the garage and set him in his box under a shady tree.  I thought for sure he would fly out and live the hummingbird life, but he just sat there.  I guessed that he was dehydrated and needed food, so Naomi and I rushed inside and filled a little lid with sugar mixed with water.  We brought it out to him to find that Marina had given him a flower to lift his spirits.\r\n  \r\n  <center><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9338544067/\" title=\"Hummingbird by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3832/9338544067_82e66c4ceb_z.jpg\" width=\"478\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Hummingbird\"></a></center>\r\n  \r\n  He just perched on the lid, but didn't try to drink the water.  I thought that I could help him out if I could get a drop of the sugary water on my finger and put it in front of his beak then surely he would drink it and fly away to frolic with his other hummingbird friends.\r\n  \r\n  <center><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9341328864/\" title=\"Hummingbird by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3751/9341328864_9bfeda0e49_z.jpg\" width=\"478\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Hummingbird\"></a></center>\r\n  \r\n  I could see and feel his needle-like tongue come out from his tiny beak to lap up the water.  The droplet on my finger disappeared, and he spent a good deal of time swallowing it.  We repeated that a few times and we all gained hope that he would live his hummingbird dream of hovering in front of flowers and dive bombing birds who dared perch on his tree.\r\n  \r\n  Instead, he just sat there.  He didn't try to drink on his own.  I thought that maybe he just needed a bit of time to process the sugary goodness we gave him, so back to our projects we went.  I took the girls to Arti's mom's to spend the day, and then came back home.\r\n  \r\n  The first thing I did was to check on Mr. Hummingbird.  He was still perched on the lid, head high, but not trying to leave or drink or anything.\r\n  \r\n  <center><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9338544807/\" title=\"Hummingbird by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2851/9338544807_b248265a57_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" alt=\"Hummingbird\"></a></center>\r\n  \r\n  I did some more bike projects, and went for a short ride.  When I came back I was hoping not to see my featherweight friend.  Instead, he was still in the box.  But he was gone.\r\n  \r\n  <center><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9341329294/\" title=\"Hummingbird by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7310/9341329294_cb9697e2b4_z.jpg\" width=\"478\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Hummingbird\"></a></center>\r\n  \r\n  His little feet were still clinging to the lid, but there was no life left in him.  I guess it was just his time to go.  We had an interesting couple of days, my hummingbird friend and I.\n:excerpt: The story of a weekend spent in and out of the garage with a hummingbird.\n:thumb_url: http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3751/9341328864_9bfeda0e49_q.jpg\n:title: Two Days With a New Friend\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  When I bought my bike last September, I didn't think I would ride it too much.  Because of that, I decided to get a pretty good bike, but not one with high end stuff on it.  I ended up with a Canondale Trail SL4 29er, which has a good frame, but the rest of it is kind of low-end -- Shimano Alivio/Acera components and a no-name front fork (RST Deuce TNL).\r\n  <center>\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/8330666813/\" title=\"Bike at the ready by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8491/8330666813_120e9645f3_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" alt=\"Bike at the ready\"></a>\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  It ended up that I rode almost every day.  I found a <a href=\"http://app.strava.com/activities/69337629\">great route between Palo Alto and San Jose</a>, and would ride the 25 miles home from work 2-5 days per week.  I'd ride to the train station every morning, and took it out on the trails almost every weekend.  I was putting 50-150 miles per week on the bike and loving it!  The downside was that it needed constant maintenance.  About every 50 miles of commuting I would need to adjust the derailleurs.  Really torqueing on the pedals would impart enough flex in the chainwheels to hear and see the chain rub on the front derailleur.  Riding off-road was a harrowing experience, with the shock barely keeping the front tire connected to the trail on rough downhill sections.  I had more than a couple white knuckle descents struggling to hold on to the handlebars on faster parts.  Still, I wouldn't give up the bike for anything.\r\n  \r\n  After one trail ride where some chain suck led to a bent chainwheel, I looked for alternatives.\r\n  \r\n  I found a full <a href=\"http://www.blueskycycling.com/product/5440/67/Shimano_XT_M770_Kit_9_Speed.htm\">Shimano XT 3x9 speed drivetrain kit at Blue Sky Cycling</a> for a good price.  It included a new 11-34 casette (rear gears), rear derailleur, bottom bracket (bearing that supports the cranks), cranks, chainwheels, chain, front derailleur, and shifter pods.  This would be a nice upgrade from the parts on the bike, which were 3x8 speed with a 12-32 cassette.  The new gears would be better for both fast commutes and for steep climbs.\r\n  \r\n  I also looked at what fork Cannondale put on the highest end Trail SL1 model.  Cannondale uses a nonstandard steerer tube (straight 1.5\"), so there's a very limited selection available.  It ends up Cannondale uses a Rock Shox Recon Gold TK 80mm unit, which I <a href=\"http://www.bikewagon.com/rock-shox-recon-gold-tk-120mm-29er-fork-solo-air-1-5in-black\">ordered from Bikewagon</a> for $300.\r\n  \r\n  All the parts arrived a few days after ordering -- a good experience from both online retailers.  The XT parts are just gorgeous.  They have metal where my old components had plastic, and the metal is of a finer quality.  The cranks and bottom bracket are super stout, and the chainwheels have a precision that I haven't had on a bike.\r\n  \r\n  It took all my self control to not just dive in and take the bike apart and put the new stuff on.  I needed a working bike for a triathlon I was doing that weekend.  Friday night, I wasn't sure if I was more excited about the tri or about being able put all the new stuff on the bike afterward!\r\n  \r\n  Replacing the components went without a hitch.  I had been reading and watching videos on how to replace and adjust the various parts, and I was ready.  Of special note were <a href=\"http://sheldonbrown.com/\">Sheldon Brown's very well written how-to articles</a> on his site.  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86lBd4KwsM\">This YouTube video</a> was helpful for seeing how easy replacing the bike fork was.  I also amassed the special tools needed for the job -- a crank puller (for the old cranks), Hollowtech II bottom bracket tool, cassette tool, chain whip, and chain breaker tool.\r\n  \r\n  I got the new components on the bike and adjusted per Sheldon Brown's instructions.  The new fork has an air-spring that needed to be adjusted for my weight.  A helpful guy at Hyland Bikes down the street helped me find the right inflation pressure for that (about 130psi).  He also confirmed the damping setting on the fork, which the old fork didn't have.\r\n  \r\n  Some photos of the new stuff:\r\n  <center><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9378695283/\" title=\"new components by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5500/9378695283_8103f7dc5c_n.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"320\" alt=\"new components\"></a>\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9381481032/\" title=\"new components by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3760/9381481032_f6091f43ac_n.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"320\" alt=\"new components\"></a>\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9378667385/\" title=\"new rear mech by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5329/9378667385_0e35f728e8_n.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"320\" alt=\"new rear mech\"></a>\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9381453056/\" title=\"new front mech by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5543/9381453056_f9b473a539_n.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"239\" alt=\"new front mech\"></a>\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  Here's the old junky stuff:\r\n  <center><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9381453510/\" title=\"old stuff by thenobot, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5533/9381453510_b2022da350_n.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"320\" alt=\"old stuff\"></a></center>\r\n  \r\n  After a week of commuting (85 miles) and a <a href=\"http://app.strava.com/activities/70196641\">trip up and down Mt. Allison</a>, I'm super happy to have done this work on the bike.  The bike shifts crisply and flawlessly.  There is absolutely no flex in the cranks, and no wobble in the chainrings.  The front fork is plush where the old one was jarring.  While I haven't set any records on the commute yet, I took more than 10% off my best time up Mt. Allison with the new setup.  The descent from Mt. Allison was drama free, almost like someone cleared all the rocks off the trail.  Not once did I think my hands were going to come off the handlebars.  Sweet!\r\n  \r\n  The XT components are more than a pound lighter than the stuff it replaced.  The shock is also more than a pound lighter than the one that came on the bike.  All in all this cut almost 10% off of the weight of the bike.  I can feel it accelerating or picking up the bike to lift the onto the CalTrain.\r\n  \r\n  The money I put into the bike is roughly equivalent to just purchasing the high-end Trail SL1 new.  The front shock is the same, but the XT components on my bike are better quality than those on the SL1.  The experience from doing all the work myself has its own value.  Now I know what all those little screws do on the shifting mechanisms, and can keep the bike in super shape now.\r\n  \r\n  So for anyone with a Trail SL4, know that these upgrades are not only possible, but pretty easy to do yourself!\r\n  \r\n  ps, I also trued my wheels this week after watching this excellent video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcZ1jjB_AdQ\n:excerpt: A report from a week with some awesome upgrades to my bike.  I learned a lot about bikes, adjustments, and found some great resources in doing this project.\n:thumb_url: http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5543/9381453056_f9b473a539_q.jpg\n:title: Bike Upgrade Confirmation\n"

These are awesome pedals, with very smooth bearings and 20 screw-in studs per pedal that keep your shoe from slipping off the pedal.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  It was a great upgrade, but I decided I wanted the option of clipless pedals for <a href=\\\"http://app.strava.com/activities/80385178\\\">long commute rides</a> and <a href=\\\"http://app.strava.com/activities/78908410\\\">weekend trail climbs</a>.  Clipless pedals are kind of a misnomer -- you clip into them with special shoes with a metal flange screwed into the bottom of the shoe, and are then locked to the bike so you can give power to the bike on both the down and up stroke.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The Shimano PD-A530 is a hybrid pedal -- clip-in on one side, and platform on the other. The platform side is not that great.  My first test ride had my foot sliding all over the place compared with the Answer Roves.  So I decided to fix that by transplanting the studs from the Roves to the Shimanos.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Before:<br/>\\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9711265615/\\\" title=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals by thenobot, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5506/9711265615_61954a22a9_n.jpg\\\" width=\\\"239\\\" height=\\\"320\\\" alt=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals\\\"></a>\\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9714497714/\\\" title=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals by thenobot, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3789/9714497714_4e1191d643_n.jpg\\\" width=\\\"320\\\" height=\\\"239\\\" alt=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals\\\"></a>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After:<br/>\\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9714494850/\\\" title=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals by thenobot, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7358/9714494850_c7d4c362c9_n.jpg\\\" width=\\\"239\\\" height=\\\"320\\\" alt=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals\\\"></a>\\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9714509586/\\\" title=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals by thenobot, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5441/9714509586_cabfe9f1b6_n.jpg\\\" width=\\\"320\\\" height=\\\"239\\\" alt=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals\\\"></a>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <a style=\\\"display:block; float:right;\\\" href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9711261811/\\\" title=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals by thenobot, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7288/9711261811_bd19647f80_n.jpg\\\" width=\\\"239\\\" height=\\\"320\\\" alt=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals\\\"></a>\\r\\n\\\n  This was a pretty easy job.  It requires the following tools:\\r\\n\\\n  <ul>\\r\\n\\\n  <li>Bench grinder or angle grinder</li>\\r\\n\\\n  <li>Drill with 1/8\\\" bit</li>\\r\\n\\\n  <li>4mm-0.70 tap (I bought one from OSH)</li>\\r\\n\\\n  <li>6mm socket and ratchet</li>\\r\\n\\\n  </ul>\\r\\n\\\n  <br clear=\\\"both\\\">\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Start by grinding off the raised portions of the platform side with a bench grinder or angle grinder.  I didn't grind it flush because I wanted some additional thickness for the studs to screw into.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9714508296/\\\" title=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals by thenobot, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3751/9714508296_7d8b1a41d0_n.jpg\\\" width=\\\"239\\\" height=\\\"320\\\" alt=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals\\\"></a>\\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9714498906/\\\" title=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals by thenobot, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5346/9714498906_759694d354_n.jpg\\\" width=\\\"320\\\" height=\\\"239\\\" alt=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals\\\"></a>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After grinding, put the pedal in a vise and drill holes for the studs using the 1/8\\\" drill bit.  I found that giving the drill bit a squirt of WD-40 helped it cut faster and cleaner. The platform is made of cast aluminum which is pretty easy to work with.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9714506916/\\\" title=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals by thenobot, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5529/9714506916_7c1deb592f_n.jpg\\\" width=\\\"320\\\" height=\\\"239\\\" alt=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals\\\"></a>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  After drilling, time to tap those holes.  I got the tap and holder from my local OSH.  The tap is 4mm-0.70, which is the same thread spec as the studs I was using.  The tap also benefits from a spray of WD-40 prior to tapping each hole.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9711271051/\\\" title=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals by thenobot, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2847/9711271051_5b59fd84c0_n.jpg\\\" width=\\\"320\\\" height=\\\"239\\\" alt=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals\\\"></a>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  From here, screw in the studs!\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9711269803/\\\" title=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals by thenobot, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3784/9711269803_ed30664b2e_n.jpg\\\" width=\\\"320\\\" height=\\\"239\\\" alt=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals\\\"></a>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  I originally drilled 12 holes per pedal, but this put pairs of the studs too close to one another.  I removed four of the studs, leaving eight studs per pedal.  This spacing seems just right.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/9714501728/\\\" title=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals by thenobot, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3781/9714501728_05bbd17534_n.jpg\\\" width=\\\"239\\\" height=\\\"320\\\" alt=\\\"Studding Shimano PD-A530 Pedals\\\"></a>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Overall this is a huge improvement for these pedals.  They're not as good as the Roves, but they come fairly close.  \"\n"

We stayed in a small house just across the street from the Poipu Beach Park.  We went boogie boarding every morning, one time with a huge sea turtle and a pod of spinner dolphins.  I ran up the coast a bit, and across the island on the Powerline Trail.  We visited Waimea Canyon and kayaked up the Wailua River then hiked to Secret Falls.  This was a vacation where we didn't want to come back home!\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7295/10915235875_cd8872d73c_m.jpg\n:id: \"72157637783433963\"\n:num_photos: 77\n"

It ended up being a minute slower than my prior &quot;run and fast walk combo&quot; ascent, but perhaps there is a future of more speed?\n  \n  I continued to Mt. Allison for the awesome view of MP from the south, then descended as it got dark.\n  \n  At the beginning of the fast part of the descent I barely caught up with another runner.  He was going fast, but I was a tiny bit faster in that section.  We exchanged greetings as I went by.  The trail got steeper, and I could hear him catching up.

  data: "--- \n:excerpt: Upgrading from a regular hard drive to an SSD seemed complicated at first on this computer, but with the right tools and instructions it was easy.\n:title: Mid-2010 iMac SSD Upgrade\n:thumb_url: https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2868/13470481845_4b88c23aeb_q.jpg\n:content: |-\n  Our almost four year old iMac has felt a little sluggish compared with my work laptop (a new MacBook Air).  I upgraded it to 8GB of RAM soon after we got it, which brought a good speed improvement, but it seems that it's been chugging away at reading and writing to the hard drive lately.  It came with a 500GB Western Digital hard drive (aka \"spinning rust\") that can transfer about 120 MB/second with a 9 millisecond (ms) average seek time.  \r\n  \r\n  A traditional hard drive stores data on spinning platters, and reads data using a read/write head -- much like a record player.  In order to read data from different places on the disk, a traditional hard drive has to reposition, or \"seek\", the read/write head, and wait until the right section of the spinning platter is under the head before it can start.  It's incredible that this can be done in 9ms (0.009 seconds) on average, but in computer time that's very very slow.  Because data is scattered all over the platters, there is a lot of seeking that happens when you launch applications, open documents, or reboot the computer.\r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/13470584133\" title=\"hard_drive by Zack Steinkamp, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7114/13470584133_872d0272fd_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"378\" alt=\"hard_drive\"></a>\r\n  <br/><em>Traditional 500GB hard disk.</em>\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  In the last few years, Solid State Drives (SSDs), have become increasingly common.  SSDs store data on computer chips, like the memory card in a digital camera.  There are no moving parts, so they are not fragile like a traditional hard disk.  The biggest advantage of an SSD is that it can read and write data from anywhere on its chips in the same amount of time, regardless of where on the chips the data is stored.  A read or write operation on an SSD takes a fraction of a single millisecond, and because of they do not rely on spinning platters beneath a read/write head, can transfer data at a much higher rate than a traditional hard drive.  \r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/13470481845\" title=\"ssd by Zack Steinkamp, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2868/13470481845_4b88c23aeb_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"489\" alt=\"ssd\"></a>\r\n  <br/><em>500GB Solid State Drive (SSD)</em>\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  On the downside, SSDs tend to be more expensive than hard drives.  Budget hard drives cost roughly $0.05 per gigabyte, where consumer-level SSDs are ten times that at about $0.50 per gigabyte.  Hard drive prices are starting to flatten out, but SSDs continue to get cheaper over time as manufacturers scale their production.\r\n  \r\n  So rather than spend $2000 on a new computer, I thought I would try replacing the old mechanical hard drive with an SSD.  After doing a bit of research, I settled on the Samsung 840 EVO drive, in the same 500GB capacity as the drive that was in the computer.  It has been <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/7173/samsung-ssd-840-evo-review-120gb-250gb-500gb-750gb-1tb-models-tested\">benchmarked at over 500 MB/sec</a>, which is 4x faster than the drive it would replace.  The seek time is irrelevant with an SSD, so any disk operation will see an average of 9ms improvement, which is huge.  For less than $300 this was worth a try.\r\n  \r\n  I found some pretty good video instructions on how to replace the hard drive in this generation iMac.  \r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/MeLchCCtHy8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  I ended up using only a single suction cup to remove the glass (most instructions call for two).  After removing the 8 T-10 screws, I carefully lifted the display.  I only needed to disconnect the screen temp sensor and data cable in order to get the job done.  Everything else could be done with the screen propped up.  The SSD is a 2.5\" form factor, but the old hard drive was a 3.5\".  Adapters exist, and the $15 \"EZConvert MB882SP-1S-2B\" from Icy Dock worked perfectly.  I removed the old drive, transferred the T-8 mounting pins and bracket to the SSD/Adapter, and installed it.  \r\n  \r\n  There is a temperature sensor that connects to the original hard drive, but there is nowhere to connect it to the new drive.  If you leave it disconnected, the hard drive cooling fan will run at maximum (loud) speed.  When Apple shipped these iMacs with the SSD option, they just jumped the two pins on the temperature connector, so I did just that with a short length of bell wire (solid copper core wire) in the end of the connector that would have connected to the hard drive and secured that with some electrical tape.\r\n  \r\n  Everything buttoned back up easily.  Since we have an external drive connected to the computer that does Time Machine backups, restoring to the new drive was a snap.  Boot the computer holding down the \"Option\" key, boot to the Time Machine volume, start Disk Utility and partition/format the new SSD, then restore the data from the backup to the new drive.  The restore took about 6 hours in our case.\r\n  \r\n  I went to sleep while it was restoring, and woke up to a computer that was indistinguishable from where I powered it down last night to start the job.  Amazing!\r\n  \r\n  The one final step was to enable <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim_(computing)\">TRIM support</a> on the SSD.  By default, OSX only recognizes Apple SSDs as having TRIM support.  There are a few utilities to enable TRIM for non-Apple SSDs.  I chose <a href=\"http://www.cindori.org/software/trimenabler/\">Trim Enabler</a> and it worked fine.  Install the software, launch it (hold down the Control key while opening it since it isn't digitally signed) and flip the switch \"On\".  Reboot the computer, and hold down Command-S to enter single-user mode, then run:\r\n  <div>\r\n  <pre class=\"code\">\r\n    > fsck -fy\r\n    > reboot\r\n  </pre>\r\n  </div>\r\n  Look for the line \"** Trimming unused blocks.\" in the fsck output.  This completes the TRIM process by adding TRIM information to existing data on the drive.\r\n  \r\n  The computer now boots in about 10 seconds, where it would previously take over a minute.  It is now totally silent, and will run cooler.  All in all, this was an easy and fun upgrade!\n"

Great weather, excellent aid stations, and better preparation than last year led to a finishing time that I was really happy with.  \r\n  \r\n  Arti and the girls dropped me off at the Mission Peak trailhead in Fremont at around 7:30am.  The busses that brought most of the other runners from Del Valle had already arrived, but the registration line was short. I checked in, got my number, and then milled about finding the handful of folks I knew.  MarkF and Zombie Christopher were running Ohlone for the first time, JerryR was running it for the 18th time, and JohnnyB, who I finally met face-to-face, was looking to improve on his 2nd place finish from last year.  The crowd seemed pretty relaxed this time... or maybe it was just me.\r\n  \r\n  Having accomplished my goal of finishing the race last year, I decided I'd put a little more into it this year.  My fitness had been improving all year, particularly since January.  I lost 10 more pounds, stabilizing at or below 180 for the last 6 months -- this is more than 30 fewer pounds than my peak weight from 4 years ago.  Arti has inspired me to push harder in my workouts and it's paid off.  I've had a string of PRs throughout the year on all of my usual trails, and I've really gotten to know what my body needs nutrition-wise while running for a long time.  My strategy last year was \"walk anything but downhills\".  This year it was \"run anything but steep uphills\".\r\n  \r\n  My fueling strategy was to refill my 100oz water bladder twice -- once at Sunol (mile 9.5) and once at Maggie's Half Acre (mile 21).  I brought enough sugary stuff (Huma gels and Honey Stinger chews) for the whole race, but I'd grab at least one PB+J and/or potatoes from each of the 6 aid stations.  This would give me plenty of calories, and minimize stopped time at the aid stations for refilling water.\r\n  \r\n  At 8:00am sharp, the starting countdown reached zero, and the herd was off.  I started near the back of the pack, but had decided to jog to the first cattle guard for a bit of a warmup.  This got me past about half of the field, then it was shift to power hike most of the way up the Peak Trail, except for a couple places where it levels off.  Having run and hiked up these trails countless times, I was well prepared for how much effort I should spend in this first part.  I knew I probably wouldn't PR this opening climb, but I wanted it to be close.  I passed quite a few people on these first steep climbs, and so I was finding my position in the field.\r\n  \r\n  The weirdest part of the race happened on my favorite part of this first climb.  It's where the \"Ohlone Extra Mile\" section of the course traverses one of the hills south of the peak to meet up with the Horse Heaven Trail again.  There are a few very small (6 feet across) swampy areas here, where water oozes out of the ground and makes some mud.  Since there wasn't much rain this year, there was only one of these mud bogs.  I had passed the bog several times in the weeks leading up to the race, so I knew what to expect.  As we approached it, there was a gentleman sitting just above the bog, mud up to his thighs, and no shoes.  He had an Ohlone 50K number on, running clothes, and a very defeated look on his face.  From what I understand, he had started early (this is an option) and misjudged the depth of the mud when he crossed and sunk in past his knees.  When some of the front-runners who started at the official time came upon him, they stopped to help.  At one point four or five people were trying to pull him out of the mud!  I'm not sure if he continued, but I doubt he was able to pull his shoes out.\r\n  \r\n  After another mile I got to the peak, then it was about 5 miles of downhill to Sunol.  I grabbed two PB&J at the Laurel Loop aid station -- eating one and putting the other in my shorts pocket for halfway down the hill.  My downhill form is less consistent than I'd like, and so downhill runs are hit-or-miss for me these days.  Some days I feel strong and in control going fast down hills, and others I feel heavy and clumsy, pounding the trail.  This was a medium-bad downhill day for me, so I kept it to a moderate pace to make sure I didn't clydesdale out.\r\n  \r\n  At Sunol (mile 9.5) I felt warmed up and ready to tackle the last 2/3 of the race.  Refilled water, grabbed some potatoes+salt and a couple PB&J, and set off for the 10 mile climb up to Rose Peak.  The trail starts off flat, then climbs fairly steeply for a couple miles, then descends about 500 feet to the Backpack Area (13 miles, another aid station, another PB&J), then climbs to Rose Peak.  I had been drinking pretty steadily along the way, and so I decided to refill water at the Goat Rock aid station (16 miles) just to be safe.  I don't like to have to ration water unless it's necessary, and I wasn't 100% sure I'd make it another 5 miles on what I had.  I probably would have, but mind games are a powerful force in a race like this.\r\n  \r\n  It was a bit less than an hour of hard climbing to get to Rose Peak.  The course circles the peak then heads to Maggie's Half Acre aid station (21 miles).  This was the most awesome aid station on the whole run!  Along with more PB&J and potatoes, they had fresh and COLD cantaloupe and strawberries.  Oh yes, this was AWESOME.  What a spirit lifter!\r\n  \r\n  The course continues for the last 10 miles along steep rolling hills, some significant downhills, mixed with some unkind climbs, most notably at mile 27-28 where after a long descent, the trail ascends a ridge to gain about 500 feet in a mile.  This isn't the steepest part of the race by a long shot, but at that point it feels like it.\r\n  \r\n  From here, it's all downhill to the finish.  I had been texting my position to Arti along the way so that she and the girls could meet me at the finish without waiting too long.  At mile 29 I send her the note \"2 to go\".  She replied a few minutes later saying \"oh no, we are still 8 miles from Del Valle!\"  My heart sank.  Either she was playing with me, or I was in for a lonely finish, or she'd speed and make it just in time.  Regardless, I was not going to slow down.  I knew I was making great time so far, and I wanted to do as well as possible.\r\n  \r\n  Of course, Arti and the girls were right there cheering me on as I dropped out from the trees in the final chute.  I was running as fast as I could at that moment!  I swerved over to where they were to high-five them.  Then I looked at the timing display -- 6:43:xx as I crossed the finish line -- more than 90 minutes faster than last year!\r\n  \r\n  Larry England was there again to congratulate every finisher and give them their finisher wood plank and goodie bag.  This is a nice touch.\r\n  \r\n  Along with some cold grapefruit soda, yogurt, and bagel with cream cheese, Arti and the girls brought a small tub and filled it with ice water so I could soak my feet.  Ahhhh!  This was an excellent surprise, and welcome relief for my poor toes.\r\n  \r\n  Overall I don't think the race could have gone smoother.  I was happy to be able to push myself to finish well vs. just finish.  I'm looking forward to Ohlone 2015 to see if I can do better than 6:30...\r\n  \r\n  <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/activities/142865499/embed/5454c92d03077a06ca321a80f7d78403b9c1bdaa'></iframe>\n:title: 20140518 Ohlone Wilderness 50K Trail Race\n:primary_photo_id: \"14030604819\"\n:excerpt: It was a fantastic day for the O50K run.

It is fairly steep for the first 2 miles, then it gets crazy steep -- with a series of 30 ropes to use to climb some nearly vertical sections.\n  \n  It had rained 1.5&quot; yesterday, so the trail was very slick and muddy.  Just getting up the first part was a challenge.  After I climbed up one rope, I wasn't feeling like it was a great idea to continue on, so I cut it short and ran back to the house.\n  \n  I'd love to go back on a drier day.  I think it would be even more fun and challenging!\n  \n  <a href=\"http://www.strava.com/activities/149108067\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.strava.com/activities/149108067</a>\n:title: 20140603 Okolehau Trail Run\n:link: http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/sets/72157644587792027/\n:primary_photo_id: \"14336711211\"\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3846/14336711211_cc85df5c0a_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 07:46:10\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3846/14336711211_cc85df5c0a_s.jpg\n  :description: The Okolehau Trail runs along the ridge on the left side of this photo.\n  :title: Taro Fields\n  :id: \"14336711211\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 08:03:58\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3891/14153382229_f063f0dbbb_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: First Overlook - Power Lines\n  :id: \"14153382229\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 08:13:58\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5485/14153425530_1d6c359479_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Official Marker\n  :id: \"14153425530\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 08:34:03\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3903/14153544087_440a97bec1_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: First Rope\n  :id: \"14153544087\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 08:34:26\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3880/14360228223_774730c7fd_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: First Rope\n  :id: \"14360228223\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 08:35:28\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3885/14336695451_3bf6723385_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Muddy Trail\n  :id: \"14336695451\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 08:37:49\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3894/14153528937_6269200aab_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Steep and Muddy\n  :id: \"14153528937\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 08:40:55\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3913/14153396560_19a8e09caa_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Wild Orchids\n  :id: \"14153396560\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 08:49:59\n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2932/14339214834_f95692772f_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Amazing Vista\n  :id: \"14339214834\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 08:52:53\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3900/14339254604_762e948355_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Beautiful Pano\n  :id: \"14339254604\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 08:53:07\n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2895/14153353020_3e6dc250ec_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Views are Awesome\n  :id: \"14153353020\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 09:00:55\n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2930/14153295259_27ba98e660_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Evergreen Grove\n  :id: \"14153295259\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 13:12:23\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5080/14153297159_f984744598_s.jpg\n  :description: Nourishment on the run.\n  :title: Rip van Waffels\n  :id: \"14153297159\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 09:16:55\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3916/14339174784_e0cf420382_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Back to the Taro\n  :id: \"14339174784\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-03 09:35:10\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3885/14153339220_facccd0aa7_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Muddy Self\n  :id: \"14153339220\"\n:id: \"72157644587792027\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:description: |-\n  We drove to the end of the Kuhio Highway this morning. Arti and the girls played at Ke'e Beach while I took off on the Kalalau Trail to run up to Hanakapiai Falls, 8 miles round trip climbing 3600 feet along the way.\n  \n  It was another really fun, challenging, and technical run.  It rained on and off all night, so the trail was really muddy, with streams and pools of water along the way.  Even without the mud, the trail goes over many stream crossings, boulder fields, and scrambles to keep things interesting.\n  \n  The waterfall at the end was pretty spectacular, falling down a cliff about 500 feet high.\n  \n  The run back was great, despite the trail being pretty busy.  I managed to help a bunch of people across streams and technical sections, which is a lot of fun in a boy scout sort of way :).\n  \n  The girls were ready to pack up once I got back to Ke'e beach, so the timing worked out really well! \n  \n  <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/activities/150299470/embed/e7260e277df540c0978339ebc09a618cb025115a'></iframe>\n:link: http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/sets/72157644995653276/\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2899/14175748809_6a39de24f6_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5499/14359095291_3b074f4750_s.jpg\n  :title: Trail\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 09:13:09\n  :id: \"14359095291\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2918/14359089761_4024fa75c0_s.jpg\n  :title: Trail\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 09:17:58\n  :id: \"14359089761\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2899/14175748809_abce255503_s.jpg\n  :title: Hanakapiai Beach Cairn\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 09:20:06\n  :id: \"14175748809\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3894/14382592283_1bd9729c45_s.jpg\n  :title: Hanakapiai Beach\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 09:23:10\n  :id: \"14382592283\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2920/14339316636_1a60fe6b5c_s.jpg\n  :title: Where to step?\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 09:33:43\n  :id: \"14339316636\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2926/14361528054_974bd44d49_s.jpg\n  :title: Stream Crossing\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 09:53:16\n  :id: \"14361528054\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5596/14175765719_64462eb034_s.jpg\n  :title: Streamy Trail\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 09:53:57\n  :id: \"14175765719\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2906/14360901602_a0cd1a3368_s.jpg\n  :title: Muddy Pools on the trail\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 09:54:53\n  :id: \"14360901602\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3842/14175801548_b27476517a_s.jpg\n  :title: First view of Hanakapiai Falls\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 10:02:24\n  :id: \"14175801548\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2914/14175776589_bf27d59747_s.jpg\n  :title: Waterfall across the trail\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 10:03:59\n  :id: \"14175776589\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2918/14361546604_e4042528ac_s.jpg\n  :title: Hanakapiai Stream\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 10:06:37\n  :id: \"14361546604\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3839/14339340216_579ff06555_s.jpg\n  :title: Hanakapiai Falls Signs\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 10:15:51\n  :id: \"14339340216\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5032/14175868140_84d44c4d18_s.jpg\n  :title: Hanakapiai Falls\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 10:19:22\n  :id: \"14175868140\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2901/14362453355_ff550c43e5_s.jpg\n  :title: Hanakapiai Falls Vertical Pano\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 10:21:04\n  :id: \"14362453355\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3847/14175979257_ffbbf56000_s.jpg\n  :title: Bamboo Grove\n  :pub_date: 2014-06-06 10:51:28\n  :id: \"14175979257\"\n:excerpt: We drove to the end of the Kuhio Highway this morning.

Easy, good.\n  \n  Saturday morning brought us to the Hanalei Pier so the girls could do some running races put on by the Hanalei Canoe Club.  This was the 35th year of the event, and they had more than 750 participants.  The girls did a 1 mile out-and-back from the pier, and Arti did the 8 mile race from Ke'e Beach back to the Hanalei Pier.  Afterward, the club treated everyone to a delicious pancake breakfast.\n  \n  We headed to Anini Beach later on to meet up with some new friends to snorkel and play in the water.  Arti and I saw three sea turtles while we were out there.\n  \n  We came home for lunch, rested a bit, then headed back to Hanalei Beach for even more beach time.\n:title: 20140607 Homemade Sushi, Morning Race, Beach\n:link: http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/sets/72157644653037599/\n:primary_photo_id: \"14347468536\"\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5487/14347468536_b8f52018d4_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :pub_date: 2014-06-06 17:44:23\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3838/14390710213_4b998ce922_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Daily Papaya\n  :id: \"14390710213\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-06 19:12:03\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5194/14369048342_15642e413f_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: How We (Sushi) Roll\n  :id: \"14369048342\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-06 19:15:29\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3920/14184074107_cf26466e64_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Homemade Sushi and Sesame Tofu Stack\n  :id: \"14184074107\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 06:56:00\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3854/14183961120_730994b8cd_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Pre-Race Rainbow Portrait\n  :id: \"14183961120\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 07:05:50\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5482/14183922758_cc78400e5c_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Pre-Race\n  :id: \"14183922758\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 07:20:06\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3922/14183965520_cc9fc8a107_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Naomi and Marina in the final stretch\n  :id: \"14183965520\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 07:20:06\n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2910/14184087467_0754bb92a0_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Naomi and Marina finish the Hanalei Canoe Club 1 Mile race\n  :id: \"14184087467\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 07:21:53\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5547/14183926298_0cb9fb49db_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: 1 Mile Race Finishers\n  :id: \"14183926298\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 07:39:48\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5593/14347460626_db3ac4d03b_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Hanalei Bay Rainbow\n  :id: \"14347460626\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 07:47:09\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3912/14183938868_1a1bb6acd6_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Under the Hanalei Pier\n  :id: \"14183938868\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 07:48:48\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5554/14183928249_0b87eeef25_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Between-Race Beach Time\n  :id: \"14183928249\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 08:17:05\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5487/14347468536_b8f52018d4_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Arti finishes the Hanalei Canoe Club 8 mile race from Ke'e Beach to the Hanalei Pier\n  :id: \"14347468536\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 08:25:37\n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2940/14183934259_c049b14e3c_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Race Finishers!\n  :id: \"14183934259\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 08:34:41\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3925/14390761293_6c499828f5_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Post-Race Pancake Breakfast\n  :id: \"14390761293\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 08:48:16\n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2909/14184127677_ca373a0140_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Naomi gets her 3rd place medal\n  :id: \"14184127677\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 08:49:10\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5571/14183957439_21e8a84d92_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Third Place Medal\n  :id: \"14183957439\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 10:49:16\n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2907/14184159987_7ecbf298aa_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Anini Beach\n  :id: \"14184159987\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 11:19:06\n  :thumb_url: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3836/14370581315_738cb5ece5_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Anini Beach Cardinals\n  :id: \"14370581315\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 16:30:36\n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2936/14369813234_9475aa723e_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Getting used to this.\n  :id: \"14369813234\"\n- :pub_date: 2014-06-07 16:44:41\n  :thumb_url: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2928/14367307511_fe9d4a27ba_s.jpg\n  :description: \n  :title: Natural Aquarium\n  :id: \"14367307511\"\n:id: \"72157644653037599\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  Some of the most memorable and enjoyable runs I've done have been at night.  Things are quieter and have a special feeling at the end of the day.  The sky turns all of its colors on the way to darkness, and if you're lucky the moon helps guide the way then.\r\n  \r\n  With Arti's ever-present encouragement, I headed out to the Mission Peak trailhead after dinner at around 7:45.  This put me on the trail just after 8pm.  Sunset and moonrise was at 8:30 on this day, so I knew most of the run would be pretty dark, especially the descent.  After a week in Hawaii with some epic but slow/technical runs and a week of general laziness to follow, I had low expectations for what I'd be able to do this evening, time-wise.\r\n  \r\n  The Stanford Ave parking lot was still full (!!) so I parked along one of the side streets.  This ended up being a blessing since it forced me to do a short warmup prior to passing through the trailhead gate.  A longer warmup would probably be beneficial but I still haven't really internalized the benefits there.\r\n  \r\n  I hit the trail feeling surprisingly good.  I ran the first quarter mile (flat-ish) feeling fast, and shifted down to hillclimbing gear once the trail shot up.  At the first cattle grate the trail gets steeper so I usually feel the need to throttle back, but this evening I didn't want to let up at all.  \r\n  \r\n  Head down, breathing at maximum, focus on keeping a pace that felt faster than before.  If I started to focus on fatigue I'd slow down, so I shifted my thoughts to solving some work problems.  That's my usual strategy to distract myself from zeroing in on how difficult this thing is that I'm doing.  I'd oscillate between solving computer problems and checking in on my pace/effort (mentally) and tried to keep moving.  \"The faster you go the sooner this is over\", I kept telling myself.\r\n  \r\n  The trail climbs about 1500 feet in the first two miles then flattens out at the Grove Trail.  I turned up the speed here for the next quarter mile, then downshifted again to hillclimbing run gear until the final climb.  Time check at the fencepost before the last super-steep climb looked good -- I knew at this point I was on personal best pace (about 30 mins) and I needed to keep pushing hard to stay with it.\r\n  \r\n  I saw two guys ahead that I thought may be Zombie Don and Zombie Zac.  They had just started the final climb and were HAULING up the hill.  I tried my best to preserve my distance to them, but I had spent a lot of energy up to this point and they pulled away ever so slowly up the last half-mile (500 feet of climbing).\r\n  \r\n  The view from the peak at night is always a stunner, and today was no different.\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/14413236345\" title=\"Mission Peak Dark Descent. New PR for the climb (40:21) and roundtrip (1:04:46). by Zack Steinkamp, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3849/14413236345_e5e83a9d1d_b.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"756\" alt=\"Mission Peak Dark Descent. New PR for the climb (40:21) and roundtrip (1:04:46).\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  I realized at the top the two guys I was chasing were not the Zombies I thought they were.  Bummer!  That would have been fun.  \r\n  \r\n  The full moon was just rising to the southeast.  It was huge and awesome looking, but I knew that since it was so low in the sky it wouldn't be doing much to illuminate the trail.  Sorry, no photos of the moon.  I was on PR pace dammit! :)\r\n  \r\n  After running to the wooden peak marker, I took a couple of swigs of water (the first of the run so far -- a record for me!) and started the descent.  Lucky for me there was still some glow in the sky to illuminate this very technical and steep part of the run.\r\n  \r\n  Hopping down this section is one of my favorite parts of doing Mission Peak.  At night it gets even more challenging.  The runs I did I Hawaii were a good lead-up to this, since in both cases I needed a super duper connection between my eyes, brain, and feet to make sure I didn't twist an ankle or fall on my face.  It wasn't a PR descent by a long shot, but it was still fast and fun.\r\n  \r\n  With such a clear sky, there was very little city-glow to light up the trail.  The moon wasn't helping -- in fact, it was kind of hurting my vision since I'd glance up to see how awesome it was, and the brightness would erode my night vision.  So no more looking at the full moon!  Just running, looking down, trying not to get blinded by hikers' flashlights they were waving around haphazardly.  \r\n  \r\n  I managed to pull off some low-7 pace miles on the way down which was surprising.  I was running somewhat conservatively because I didn't want to catch a toe on a hidden rock, but perhaps since I couldn't see all the detail I was doing fewer unnecessary small adjustments to where my feet were landing.  Who knows?\r\n  \r\n  Anyhow, I made it down without any incidents.  A cool-off jog back to the car and we were done!  I love this hill!\r\n  \r\n  <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/activities/152910179/embed/08d8082f56d83867db3dd6f3fe029d1a7c506a14'></iframe>\n:title: Mission Peak Dark Descent\n:excerpt: It's been a while since I did a night run on Mission Peak.

  data: "--- \n:title: On Building Your Security Team\n:content: \"Perhaps your company is at the point in its growth curve where you need a person dedicated to security issues, or perhaps you\\xE2\\x80\\x99re looking to reboot your security team because of some of the problems outlined below.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  What follows are over-generalizations about the best way to build a functional information security team, but that are in line with what I have seen succeed (and fail) in small and large engineering organizations.  Note that this is really focused on information security for \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cproduction\\xE2\\x80\\x9D systems (those that end-users interact with in an online business), not necessarily internal IT security or physical security, though some principles still apply.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <h3>The Ideal Team Seed</h3>\\r\\n\\\n  Your first dedicated security person should be one of your best developers.  They don\\xE2\\x80\\x99t need to be an existing employee, but their engineering skills should be top-notch.  Production security breaches are typically related poor design decisions or bugs or structural flaws in code.  The person you put in charge of security should know this in their bones, and be able to deep dive into most codebases and distributed system architectures quickly.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  This person should be charismatic and be motivated by helping other developers rather than punishing them.  Right or wrong, \\xE2\\x80\\x9Csecurity people\\xE2\\x80\\x9D have built a generally negative reputation through time as being mean or grumpy.  A good person for this role really wants to mentor other developers who may not be aware of the nuances of good security design.  They should be an excellent teacher, and a role model for how positive and effective communication in an organization is carried out.  They do not seek to shame other developers into good security.   Instead, they work hard to lift the skill and mood of their colleagues.  They light up a room.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  An effective security person understands that \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cbetter\\xE2\\x80\\x9D is better than \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cperfect\\xE2\\x80\\x9D.  They understand that \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cperfect\\xE2\\x80\\x9D is an unattainable goal, and will never go to the mat arguing to delay a product release for perfection.  They balance security with usability, understanding that a secure but unusable system will be bypassed because people just need to get their work done.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  This person educates management and developers in the company of the risks the company faces, but tempers security decisions with the tradeoffs to the success or velocity of the business.  An effective security leader has a deep respect and understanding for the business side of the business and knows when to ease up in lobbying for better security.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <h3>Growing the Team</h3>\\r\\n\\\n  As the team lead, the seed person described above should have a great filter for choosing additional team members.  Perhaps you need more mentors around the organization.  Or depending on the nature of your business or need, you need some dedicated security engineers to do some low-level work on infrastructure libraries, and who are not necessarily going to mentor others.  Another possibility is that you need to grow the team to interface with other parts of the business like the legal or customer care teams.  Still another role would be a project manager handling compliance efforts like PCI or SOX.  Each person you hire is critical, particularly in a small company.  But even in a large org, the reputation of your security team is paramount.  Compromising on personality traits will invariably tarnish your security team\\xE2\\x80\\x99s reputation, and thus, effectiveness in your organization.  \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <h3>Final Thought</h3>\\r\\n\\\n  Use this as your acid test:  Do you and others in your organization look forward to interacting with your security team?  If the answer is \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cno\\xE2\\x80\\x9D, then maybe it\\xE2\\x80\\x99s time for a reboot.  If the answer is \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cyes\\xE2\\x80\\x9D, then you\\xE2\\x80\\x99re on a great path to building a great team and product.\"\n:excerpt: \"\"\n:thumb_url: https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3886/14169117770_d2bd221c9d_q_d.jpg\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  If you have bought a Cannondale mountain bike, you may be surprised at the limited number of fork options due to Cannondale's non-standard straight 1.5\" headtube choice. Most bikes use a straight 1 1/8\" headtube. Nicer frames use a tapered 1 1/8\" to 1 1/2\" design. The larger diameter is stiffer and provides for a larger bearing surface, so Cannondale wasn't being totally arbitrary with their choice, but it's nonstandard nonetheless.\r\n  \r\n  If you're looking for a replacement, there are very few options. I got a 1.5\" Rock Shox Recon Gold TK a while back, and it's a great fork for the money -- about $300-350 online. This was made by Rock Shox for Cannondale's top-of-the-line Trail SL 29er hardtail. It was significantly better at dampening rough trails and keeping the tire in contact with the ground than the RST Deuce that came with my Trail SL4.\r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <img src=\"https://sram-cdn-pull-zone-gsdesign.netdna-ssl.com/cdn/farfuture/V4V5BwBRuFqu9gYscsLJSSW1PHLVYQDfcYHthaH-qNg/mtime:1386103064/sites/default/files/images/products/forks/fs_rcngld_tk_29q_sa100_blk_dsc_rmt_.a17l_0.jpg\">\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  As time passed and my bike habits changed, I wanted something sleek and light. Most of my riding these days is commuting to and from work, and a recent job change made it so that the commute was nearly completely on paved bike trails. My previous commute had about 8 miles of hardpack and gravel trails mixed in, so I was thankful for the front suspension. But the new commute opened the door to slick tires and a rigid front end.\r\n  \r\n  Niner Bikes makes some of the best frames out there, and they offer a rigid carbon fork for mountain bike minimalists. The only problem for me though was that they offer it only in straight 1 1/8\" or tapered 1 1/8 to 1 1/2\" fitments -- no straight 1 1/2\". After some searching, I found a solution that would let me run the fork on my Cannondale.\r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/NinerParts/CarbForkTaper/TAPERFORK_3_960x540.jpg\">\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  FSA produced a headset for a while called the Gravity One. It is designed to fit in straight 1.5\" headtube frames, but allows you to use a tapered fork. It appears that it's not in production anymore, however I did manage to find it at a couple of online retailers. You can find it at <a href=\"http://www.cannondaleexperts.com/FSA-Gravity-Tapered-Headset-for-15-Frames_p_3115.html\">Cannondale Experts</a> or <a href=\"http://www.universalcycles.com/shopping/product_details.php?id=27653\">Universal Cycles</a>.\r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <img src=\"http://www.universalcycles.com/images/products/small/27653.jpg\">\r\n  </center> \r\n  \r\n  It's a nice looking piece, with clean edges and large bearings. The package came with everything I needed to install it on my bike, including the crown race.\r\n  \r\n  To remove the existing headset cups in the frame, I made a tool using a length of 1.25\" pipe (closet rod actually). Just cut a one foot length of pipe, then make two cuts at one end of the pipe so you can splay that end out. Park Tool sells this for $30 or so, but it's pretty easy to make.\r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <img src=\"http://www.parktool.com/uploads/thumbnails/uploads/products/dd80e50f80422e0af3610dc89c5a6ca7e2ae7f53_430x390.jpg\">\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  Slide the pipe through the head tube so that the splayed ends engage one set of cups, then hammer the other end of the pipe to knock it loose. Repeat for the other cup. Simple.\r\n  \r\n  To press in the new cups, I used a Bessey woodworking clamp to gently work them in and keep them square.\r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <img src=\"http://www.besseytools.com//asim_images/Graphics/Pic6/00013960_0.jpg\">\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  I used a length of 1 1/2\" PVC pipe to set the crown race on the Niner fork. This took more effort than I expected it would, but it's a super tight fit now.\r\n  \r\n  The remaining assembly from there was very straightforward. The carbon fork comes with a special insert to support the carbon steerer where the stem clamps on, along with some special paste to add friction to the steerer-stem clamping surface.\r\n  \r\n  This change took nearly 1500 grams off the weight of the bike. The steering is razor sharp, and the ride isn't so jarring that my hands or arms are tired at the end of a long ride. Coupled with changing out to 28mm slick tires, the bike is a lightweight rocket now. It weighs 21 lbs now (it was 30 when new). The fork and tires seem to be good for a 1-2 mph improvement in speed.\r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/14971096231\" title=\"FSA Gravity One headset and Niner rigid carbon fork on a Cannondale Trail SL frame. by Zack Steinkamp, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3835/14971096231_a132cb9390.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" alt=\"FSA Gravity One headset and Niner rigid carbon fork on a Cannondale Trail SL frame.\"></a>\r\n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/14971087571\" title=\"FSA Gravity One reducer headset by Zack Steinkamp, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5559/14971087571_4c5f1140d7.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" alt=\"FSA Gravity One reducer headset\"></a>\r\n  </center>\n:title: Run a Tapered Fork on a 1.5\" Cannondale\n:excerpt: \"\"\n:thumb_url: https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5559/14971087571_4c5f1140d7_q.jpg\n"

Hamilton with Richie, David, and Ruslan, I thought it would be fun to try out racing. Ruslan is an avid racer and pointed me to ncnca.org, which has a comprehensive schedule of events.\n  \n  Lucky me, there was a racing clinic this weekend followed by a criterium race!\n  \n  In the clinic, we dove right in to practicing riding in a very tight pack - touching elbows at times, then riding in a tight three-wide fomation, then a rolling paceline, and finally in single file. This lasted about 45 minutes, then we had a debrief, a few minutes break, then off to the criterium.\n  \n  A bicycle criterium is a road race of several laps around a closed-off course. In this case, it was a 40 minute race in an industrial area of Fremont, which made for 11 laps around the 2.x mile course. I raced in the &quot;Cat 5 Men's 30-44&quot; group. Cat 5 is the least experienced of all bike racing groups, which was perfect for me.\n  \n  It was a big thrill to be riding in a pack, learning all about the huge advantage of drafting. Despite losing the draft in several places, I managed to stay with the lead pack and finished around midpack.\n  \n  Fellow rider Gary Cruz put together this amazing video of the race: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq39wqdk2CM\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq39wqdk2CM</a> You can see me briefly take the lead at 13:20 :)\n  \n  I'm looking forward to the next one!\n:pub_date: 2015-02-01 13:59:51\n:photos: \n- :title: Waiting for the clinic to start.\n  :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7310/16238718389_494b6ffbdc_s.jpg\n  :description: The bikes on the course were the &quot;junior&quot; division.

Initially a coal mine, eventually it was converted to a sand mine. The regional park district gives tours of a small section of the Hazel-Atlas mine, which has been preserved to show the day-to-day workings of the mine. All in all there are hundreds of miles of mine shafts in the hills in the park. It was really surprising how extensive the underground labrynth is. The kids really enjoyed it too.\n:pub_date: 2015-03-25 10:52:05\n:title: 20150325 Black Diamond Mines Field Trip\n:id: \"72157651606152181\"\n:photos: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8750/16954842662_4c2389f67e_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :pub_date: 2015-03-25 10:12:16\n  :id: \"16954842662\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8697/16768487918_b160b5002a_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :pub_date: 2015-03-25 10:13:43\n  :id: \"16768487918\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8702/16748795467_1daeaac648_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :pub_date: 2015-03-25 10:19:13\n  :id: \"16748795467\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7638/16955213911_be484c3cdd_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :pub_date: 2015-03-25 10:36:10\n  :id: \"16955213911\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8720/16748794177_63fd0abc40_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :pub_date: 2015-03-25 10:37:05\n  :id: \"16748794177\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7590/16336080393_03910a14d9_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :pub_date: 2015-03-25 10:40:39\n  :id: \"16336080393\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8695/16769949619_03416040ba_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :pub_date: 2015-03-25 10:48:15\n  :id: \"16769949619\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7618/16748796547_7a107f40a5_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :pub_date: 2015-03-25 10:52:05\n  :id: \"16748796547\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7594/16336075543_4a0b4c521a_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :pub_date: 2015-03-25 10:53:04\n  :id: \"16336075543\"\n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7647/16768482488_8045df22dc_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :pub_date: 2015-03-25 10:54:23\n  :id: \"16768482488\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:description: |-\n  I spend a lot of money on energy gels. Each packet costs $1.25-$2.00 and contains 1-1.5 oz of gel. On a long run, I may consume as many as 6 gels. Over time, that adds up!\r\n  \r\n  I have gotten to know the kinds of food and nutrition I need while running, and none of the current gels deliver what I think is the right balance for me. I do well with a combination of complex and simple sugars, and do better with some electrolytes along the way versus taking capsules at long intervals. I don't know of a premade gel that fits what I think I need, so I decided to make my own!\r\n  \r\n  I found a basic recipe online, and have used that as a starting point. Here it is:\r\n  \r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>1c Maltodextrin Powder (I used &quot;Carbo Gain&quot;)</li>\r\n  <li>1/2c Water</li>\r\n  <li>2/3c Honey</li>\r\n  <li>1/2t Salt</li>\r\n  <li>1/2t Potassium-based Salt Substitute (I used &quot;Nu Salt&quot;)</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  \r\n  Put it all in a pan and whisk over low heat until it's well mixed. Let it cool, then you're done!\r\n  \r\n  It makes 1.5 cups of gel, or the equivalent of 12 gel packets. The cost of these materials is $4.50, which works out to less than 40 cents per virtual packet.\r\n  \r\n  Each serving has 110 calories, 100mg of sodium, and 125mg of potassium. It has a buttery flavor, and is sweet but not nearly as sweet as a product like Honey Stinger gels.\r\n  \r\n  You can add protein powder or different flavorings to the mix depending on how you feel or what you want.\r\n  \r\n  For transport and consumption, Hammer Nutrition makes a product called a Gel Flask which can hold 4-5 servings of gel. It fits in my pocket or in a pocket in my hydration vest to carry with me on runs or rides.\r\n  \r\n  Go forth and consume!\n:link: http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/sets/72157657337736298/\n:photos: \n- :description: The recipe makes 1.5 cups of gel, or enough for about 12 servings.\n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/740/20689472798_6479cbf288_s.jpg\n  :pub_date: 2015-08-24 20:39:16\n  :id: \"20689472798\"\n  :title: Finished Quantity\n- :description: The gel in a Hammer Nutrition Gel Flask.\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5692/20689388340_17599ae8e7_s.jpg\n  :pub_date: 2015-08-25 08:17:43\n  :id: \"20689388340\"\n  :title: Finished Quantity\n:num_photos: 2\n:primary_photo_id: \"20689388340\"\n:excerpt: \"\"\n:pub_date: 2015-08-25 08:17:43\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5692/20689388340_17599ae8e7_m.jpg\n:id: \"72157657337736298\"\n:title: 20150825 Homemade Energy Gel\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  I've been cooking a lot lately. I love cooking! I love the creativity of it, the chemistry and process, and of course eating good food. Given the choice, I'd take an environment like \"Chopped\" over a cookbook any day. Give me a few good ingredients and an empty plate and let's see what happens.\r\n  \r\n  Mostly I've been experimenting lately with making Indian food. With a few spices and some newly learned techniques, an entire world opened up to us. The girls' new favorite is Masala Dosa night. But not every night can be Masala Dosa night.\r\n  \r\n  This evening, I was flying solo so it was a good opportunity to get out of my comfort zone. In the fridge was a bowl of Jamaican coconut rice and beans we made and enjoyed last night, a few beets (with greens attached), and a few stalks of celery. The coconut rice was creamy with a very subtle spice. It was begging for something with some punch and a little crunch.\r\n  \r\n  Beets are a wonder food. Not only are they delicious, but the nutrition (especially in the form of nitrates) they deliver to your body can help you achieve improved athletic performance. I've never cooked beet greens, so my first instinct was to cut off the greens and toss them out. But then I thought about that and how nutritious the greens could be. After a quick google search, I found that the greens are entirely edible -- stems and all. So begins tonight's experiment that should serve two normal people. I ate the whole thing though...\r\n  \r\n  <div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" data-header=\"false\" data-footer=\"false\" data-context=\"false\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/20859813788/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Beet hash with beet greens over Jamaican coconut rice and beans.\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/564/20859813788_4703369198_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" alt=\"Beet hash with beet greens over Jamaican coconut rice and beans.\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n  <h3>Produce</h3>\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>Greens from 3 beets</li>\r\n  <li>1 beet</li>\r\n  <li>1/2 onion</li>\r\n  <li>3 stalks celery (the more interior pieces with leaves the better)</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h3>Pantry</h3>\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>1T olive oil</li>\r\n  <li>1/4t Black pepper</li>\r\n  <li>1/4t Red chili flakes</li>\r\n  <li>1/4t Allspice powder</li>\r\n  <li>1T soy sauce or Braggs</li>\r\n  <li>2T apple cider vinegar</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h3>Prep</h3>\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>Beet Greens<ul>\r\n    <li>Cut greens off beets</li>\r\n    <li>Wash beet greens</li>\r\n    <li>Separate leaves from stems</li>\r\n    <li>Chop stems 1/4\" long</li>\r\n    <li>Very rough chop leaves</li>\r\n    </ul></li>\r\n  <li>Dice beet (1/4\" cubes)</li>\r\n  <li>Dice onion</li>\r\n  <li>Cut celery into 1/4\" pieces</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h3>Cook</h3>\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet</li>\r\n  <li>Add black pepper, red chili flakes, and allspice</li>\r\n  <li>Cook spices until fragrant</li>\r\n  <li>Add beet green stems, beet, celery, and onion (all but the beet green leaves) and stir-fry.</li>\r\n  <li>Reduce heat</li>\r\n  <li>Add soy sauce and vinegar, stir well</li>\r\n  <li>Cook until most of the liquid is gone and beets are tender</li>\r\n  <li>Remove veggies from pan</li>\r\n  <li>Heat a bit more oil in the pan</li>\r\n  <li>Cook beet green leaves until they are tender</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h3>Serve</h3>\r\n  Serve over your favorite substrate or on its own.

  data: "--- \n:description: |-\n  Today was my third time running the Ohlone Wilderness 50K. It was rescheduled from its usual May start to Mid-September. Normally this would mean a cooler race, but today (and today only!) was crazy hot. Today it reached 102F in Livermore. A fellow racer had a temperature sensor on his shoe that registered over 110F in the last two thirds of the race!\r\n  \r\n  I started strong, getting my 2nd best time ever to the top of Mission Peak along the longer Ohlone 50K route (mile 4.3, 2450ft, 57:03). I took a photo of the Laurel Loop aid station volunteers and kept on running without stopping. Some friends cheering me on in Sunol (mile 9.5, 400ft) said I looked good at that point and I felt great too. A quick pit stop at the restrooms and aid station to pocket a couple PB&Js and refill water, and I started the 10 mile climb up Rose Peak. There is an aid station at mile 12.5 at the base of the Backpack Area, which marks a seriously steep climb up. I powered up this section, starting to feel the heat but nothing too bad. Around Mile 14, two younger guys with numbers were jogging the wrong way on the course, headed back to Sunol. Ends up they were two young hotshoes who went all out in the beginning of the course (seriously fast!) but things started to unravel for them around mile 15. I gave them a high five as they passed and continued to chug on. Goat Rock aid station was up ahead, and I used that opportunity to top off my water, grab some fresh strawberries, and take a PB&J for the road.\r\n  \r\n  It was really starting to get out out there. At mile 17, I was cooked. Done. I spent a few minutes sitting on a log in the shade with a couple other racers talking about how we were thinking of turning around and going back to Sunol and calling it quits. \r\n  \r\n  But I didn't work this hard to call it quits, so I got my butt off that log, wished my new friends the best, and plugged along.\r\n  \r\n  I motored up the ridiculous incline 2 miles from Rose Peak, then again for the last half mile to the peak (3850ft). At the Maggie's Half Acre aid station at mile 20, they had ice. It was cold. It came with me in my water and in my Cool Off bandana. Oh yes. Ice. Cold. Life. Their water was absolutely delicious too. Maggie's was my favorite station last year, with their ice cold cantaloupe. They still rank at the top of the list. Go Maggie's Half Acre Aid Station People!\r\n  \r\n  The refreshing cold ice, combined with the fact that at this point I knew that dropping was not a possibility (the finish was closer than the bail-point at Sunol) gave me new enthusiasm. Rolling hills followed, exposed in the sun. There is a bit of shade around the Stewart's Camp stop, which is just a spigot sticking out of the ground. There was another racer there who remarked \"I basically just took a bath under that\" and he looked really happy. This sounded like a marvelous idea -- so on went the water and in went me. It was ice cold and flowing at super high pressure. I wet my whole self down. AHHHHHH! Awesome. I let out several joyful yelps under that spigot. Then with a squish-squash in my shoes I continued down the trail.\r\n  \r\n  The rest of the course is exposed from there on out, and there are two brutal climbs until mile 29-ish, where the final aid station was.\r\n  \r\n  The last two miles or so are a super steep downhill. My knees and quads were absolutely finished by this part. I did my best shuffle down the hill without hurting worse, and managed to run like a wild man for the last 400 yards or so, inspired by the cheering sounds and cowbells at the finish.\r\n  \r\n  I crossed the line after a long 7:47:20. This was more than an hour slower than last year, but felt like a bigger accomplishment given the heat and the fact that I ran about 1/4 the number of big training runs as I planned.\r\n  \r\n  The grass at the finish was cool and in the shade. So I spent the next hour and a half or so eating, drinking, napping, and stretching. Ahhhh.\r\n  \r\n  Special thanks to Jerry and Catra for offering to drive me to the start and from the finish, and to Dave and Sherry Scott (Ohlone royalty!) for actually driving me from the finish back to Fremont. That was a fun car ride! Also thanks to all the volunteers that make this race possible, and to Larry England for basically doing twice the amount of race organizer work this year.\r\n  \r\n  Strava data is here: <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/396796398\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.strava.com/activities/396796398</a>\n:link: http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/sets/72157658477853719/\n:photos: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5806/21399316638_926db62ff5_s.jpg\n  :id: \"21399316638\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-19 20:50:44\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/668/21575884332_2a8dcee66d_s.jpg\n  :id: \"21575884332\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 07:57:15\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5689/20966098703_0b1ff54bbc_s.jpg\n  :id: \"20966098703\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 08:01:12\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/581/21575922522_b75bbce30f_s.jpg\n  :id: \"21575922522\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 08:39:40\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/767/20966081413_7e04da4ec5_s.jpg\n  :id: \"20966081413\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 08:46:56\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5812/21400264629_9731623c2f_s.jpg\n  :id: \"21400264629\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 09:12:26\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5685/21561021636_f17b206936_s.jpg\n  :id: \"21561021636\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 09:48:32\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/615/21399150360_3cc46603aa_s.jpg\n  :id: \"21399150360\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 09:50:11\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/715/21399194370_25829fc383_s.jpg\n  :id: \"21399194370\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 11:34:01\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5793/21399131310_41d3bc9736_s.jpg\n  :id: \"21399131310\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 12:45:05\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5784/20966039983_36112e4cff_s.jpg\n  :id: \"20966039983\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 12:46:10\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/762/21575893502_9bb059e319_s.jpg\n  :id: \"21575893502\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 12:58:39\n  :title: \n- :description: \n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/641/21399156480_f4663b0da0_s.jpg\n  :id: \"21399156480\"\n  :pub_date: 2015-09-20 16:14:34\n  :title: \n:primary_photo_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/615/21399150360_3cc46603aa_m.jpg\n:num_photos: 13\n:excerpt: \"\"\n:primary_photo_id: \"21399150360\"\n:id: \"72157658477853719\"\n:pub_date: 2015-09-20 09:50:11\n:title: \"20150920 Ohlone 50K: Hot Mess Edition\"\n"

Despite both girls being in &quot;no photos&quot; mode, we managed to get a handful of nice photos of them too.\n:primary_photo_id: \"20396770344\"\n:pub_date: 2015-08-30 10:06:01\n:title: 20150830 John Nicholas with the Girls\n:id: \"72157657579802108\"\n"

They had lots of unique pumpkins (orange, warty, white, grey, gourds), a petting zoon, a cow tractor ride, hampster balls, and they show movies every evening. Awesome! We will be back every day until Halloween.\n  \n  After we picked out a couple of pumpkins, we drove up the street to the Lake Ranch trailhead for a quick, steep hike up to Lake Ranch Reservoir. Along the way we collected acorns. We got to share the lake with a family of 6 deer, lots of mallard ducks, and an egret or two. Naomi briefly lost a flip flop in the mud. It was a beautiful quiet evening up there as long as nobody was hollering about lost flip flops. :)\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/619/21336109953_d990eb9a5e_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :title: Fancy Pumpkin\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 15:49:17\n  :id: \"21957222395\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/599/21957222395_3e8b45df79_s.jpg\n- :title: Alpaca at the Pumpkin Patch Petting Zoo\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 15:50:32\n  :id: \"21967004151\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5733/21967004151_5d00b2027c_s.jpg\n- :title: Duck-like gourd\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 16:10:30\n  :id: \"21769151580\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/652/21769151580_9b5004dd1d_s.jpg\n- :title: Girls with their chosen pumpkins\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 16:12:47\n  :id: \"21336109953\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/619/21336109953_d990eb9a5e_s.jpg\n- :title: Ranch Lake Trailhead\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 16:41:18\n  :id: \"21334521694\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5752/21334521694_b06e97c92f_s.jpg\n- :title: Up the dam to the lake\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:02:01\n  :id: \"21931092186\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/778/21931092186_2ce8bfb280_s.jpg\n- :title: Marina\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:03:08\n  :id: \"21945151222\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5705/21945151222_d8eb230b7f_s.jpg\n- :title: Marina and Naomi\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:03:57\n  :id: \"21336139193\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5706/21336139193_0feaf7723d_s.jpg\n- :title: The girls check out some lake stuff\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:07:14\n  :id: \"21931111856\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/588/21931111856_28425f8cbb_s.jpg\n- :title: Naomi\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:08:04\n  :id: \"21931117506\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/650/21931117506_cc71032a3e_s.jpg\n- :title: Marina gets some extra iron\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:08:52\n  :id: \"21769438918\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/656/21769438918_f80f48d5bb_s.jpg\n- :title: Bombs away!\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:10:24\n  :id: \"21769213390\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5700/21769213390_01d25b330a_s.jpg\n- :title: Unicorns\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:14:00\n  :id: \"21967079771\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5701/21967079771_e4f45128a6_s.jpg\n- :title: Cattail Sisters\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:20:26\n  :id: \"21770414849\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/571/21770414849_5d0f0f8510_s.jpg\n- :title: Flip Flops + Mud = ?\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:25:46\n  :id: \"21931154866\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/705/21931154866_36517b9350_s.jpg\n- :title: Lake Plants\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:26:33\n  :id: \"21334597824\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5687/21334597824_c3e9e66b98_s.jpg\n- :title: The Mud is Alive\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:30:13\n  :id: \"21957339125\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/705/21957339125_5eaf52d7d1_s.jpg\n- :title: Naomi had enough camera time\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 17:33:10\n  :id: \"21334617814\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5783/21334617814_e0ba1ec643_s.jpg\n- :title: Collected Acorns\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 18:29:45\n  :id: \"21770457069\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5659/21770457069_abf7c89b8b_s.jpg\n- :title: Pumpkin Decoration\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2015-10-04 18:34:03\n  :id: \"21945244312\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5759/21945244312_e923dcd31d_s.jpg\n:id: \"72157659420622556\"\n:num_photos: 20\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  I've run the Skyline to the Sea (SttS) 50K race for the last two years (2013 and 2014). This year I decided I'd skip it. The Ohlone 50K was moved to three weeks before Stts, and I had plans to do the Levi's Gran Fondo bike ride one week prior.\r\n  \r\n  But then I got to talking with my friend and awesome runner Donnie about SttS. He's placed well in the race before, and we were talking about how it would be fun to run the marathon distance option for SttS. The 50K course adds a grueling, steep, exposed 5 mile loop to the 26 mile trail. It's always been my low point in the race. To avoid that loop took about half the mental weight out of the race. So then it would be \"fun\" right?\r\n  \r\n  After Donnie and I chatted, I checked on signing up for the race. Unfortunately it was sold out by that time. Then time passed...\r\n  \r\n  I was talking with my friend Thomas recently about running. He mentioned that he was signed up for the marathon distance at SttS, but wouldn't be able to do it due to an injury. Hmmm... brain cogs start spinning. I offered to take the burden of a DNS off his hands and run it for him. He made the deal, but on one condition -- that I finish ahead of Big Johnny Burton. Normally I'd scoff at such an impossibility, but BJB was signed up for the 50K distance. He'd have to run an extra 5 miles. And not any old 5 miles, but the soul crushing loop of doom. Ok -- maybe he'd have a totally wack day and I could pull it off. Deal.\r\n  \r\n  Note that this conversation was on Friday afternoon. The race was on Saturday morning.\r\n  \r\n  So with exactly 12 hours of preparation time, I decided to run a marathon. A marathon with 3300 feet of climbing and 4800 feet of descending. No problem! I had just run the Ohlone 50K in 110F heat with over 9K feet of both climbing and descending three weeks prior. This would be a cakewalk!\r\n  \r\n  Heh...\r\n  \r\n  Up and at 'em at 4:50AM on Saturday. Breakfast, shower, gather up stuff, out the door at 6am to drive to the parking area near the finish at Waddell Beach -- about halfway between Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz. Exit the car, and hop aboard one of the yellow school busses to get a ride up to the start of the race at Saratoga Gap. The busses left at 7AM sharp, and arrived at the start at about 8:20. Quick pit stop, get my, well I mean Thomas's, number (\"Yes *I* am Thomas Andersen, the one and only. In the flesh!\"), and mosey over to the Skyline to the Sea trailhead for the 9AM start.\r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/21463285263/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Start of the 2015 Skyline to the Sea ultra.\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/640/21463285263_78632c257f_b.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Start of the 2015 Skyline to the Sea ultra.\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n  <em>The starting line.</em>\r\n  \r\n  It was hot at the starting line at the top of the hill, but once we got into the trees it was wonderfully cool.\r\n  \r\n  The race starts with a few little climbs, and I was feeling great. Passing people left and right, well primarily on the left as trail etiquette dictates. The first 6 or 7 miles went like this. It was fun! I buzzed right by the first aid stop with plenty of water and plenty of energy, so no need for any extra food.\r\n  \r\n  Then my cold that I had been battling this week started to take over. We were entering the first real climb, and my body just started to hurt. I was sweating a lot more than I should have. Things started slowing down. \"Power through it man. Sweat those bugs out,\" I'd be saying to myself.\r\n  \r\n  I was getting passed by some of the people I passed earlier. That's not a good feeling.\r\n  \r\n  At the China Grade aid station at mile 12, I took on some more water and grabbed a few Oreos. This is one of my favorite parts of the trail. It is exposed, which is a welcome change from the cool redwood canopy of most of the rest of the trail, and has some awesome rocky outcroppings that remind me of a miniature sandstone interpretation of Yosemite.\r\n  \r\n  This is where my body really started to rebel against my best intentions. I was getting some pain in my left knee and beneath my right outer ankle. They were both getting worse on every downhill. And SttS is all about the downhills.\r\n  \r\n  These pains only increased over the next 14 miles. There were some nice times when the grade was just right so as to not tickle the hurt, but those were few and far between. I'd stop and stretch and massage my left IT band to hopefully loosen it up, but for some reason the first couple of steps after I'd start going again were excruciating.\r\n  \r\n  Trudge on man.\r\n  \r\n  I was past the halfway point, so there was only one way to go. Finish. My pace dropped off considerably, but I was still moving. As long as you're moving, you're closer to your goal. One step at a time.\r\n  \r\n  Mile 16-24 is mostly downhill, steep at first but then flattens out for what feels like infinity miles. It's a very long stretch between two aid stations. At mile 22, Big Johnny came striding by. He was carrying an awesome pace. I asked him if he needed any food. He was out of water, and I was nearly out too. We were close enough to the aid stop and he was moving fast enough where I knew he'd be just fine. BJB, I hope I was right!\r\n  (update: <a href=\"http://runningjohn.blogspot.com/2015/10/2015-skyline-to-sea-50k-race-report.html\">I was not!</a>)\r\n  \r\n  The Twin Redwoods aid station at marathon mile 24 (50K mile 29) is always a welcome sight. You've been running on mostly flat ground for waaaay too long, and you know that once you get there it's only 2 miles to the finish.\r\n  \r\n  I finally made it there. Glugged some ginger ale, got a bit of water, and it was now the final climb to the home stretch.\r\n  \r\n  There's something so powerful in these races about the moment you can hear the excitement at the finish line. The pain in your body seems to disappear now that the end is so close. There are usually a few people hiking up the trail toward you who tell you wonderful things like \"less than a mile to go!\" or \"just around the next bend\". All of that filters into a pace that you didn't think was possible just a few minutes before.\r\n  \r\n  SttS has a great finish where you pop out of the trees, make a little turn, and there's the finish! You don't have to stare at it too long which is nice. That final little sprint was awesome. So many kind people were hanging out at the finish, ringing cowbells, hooting, and clapping. I got all teary again. :)\r\n  \r\n  I was hoping to finish the race in under 4h30m, but it ended up taking 4h45m. I'm pretty sure that if I had prepared just a bit more (like 18 hours instead of 12) that I could break that 4h30m goal, and possibly regain Thomas and my honor by finishing ahead of BJB. (yeah right!)\r\n  \r\n  <div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\r\n  <iframe frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/410379500/embed/6157c9038765f0d5e34f445cf46a0ec061d6ae4c'></iframe>\r\n  </div>\r\n  \r\n  Despite the pain and hobbling walk I've got now, I'm happy I made the decision to tackle this race. I will see you next year, SttS!!!\n:thumb_url: https://farm1.staticflickr.com/640/21463285263_78632c257f_q.jpg\n:title: Last Minute Marathon\n:excerpt: \"\"\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  While mindlessly surfing the internet I stumbled across <a href=\"http://autechre.ws/\">Autechre's website</a> and saw they were planning a North American tour. The San Francisco date was coming right up on October 16, 2015. Well heck yes I was going to go! Anyone who has listened to music with me knows that Autechre is #1 on my list. So I got in touch with a couple of Ae-friendly friends. It happened that Ben was as excited to go as I was, so I got us some tickets. Good thing I jumped on them, since the show sold out that week.\r\n  \r\n  I drove up to Ben's house in San Francisco, stopping for a quick charge at Peter Pan BMW service center near SFO. $10 for a charge -- ouch! But better that than have to find a place in the city or on the way home. My car could *maybe* have done the round trip on one charge, but I'd rather not be stranded.\r\n  \r\n  ANyhow, I got to Ben's at about 8pm. We hung out for a bit, walked to get some food, and made our way to the show at a club called Mezzanine. Doors were at 8:30, and the first of two openers started at 9. We got there about 9:30, right in the heat of DJ Rob Hall's set. He was playing some great music that I'd never heard. The place wasn't quite filled up, but it was still early.\r\n  \r\n  <img src=\"http://www.digitalinberlin.de/wordpress/wp-content/rhall.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\">\r\n  <em>DJ Rob Hall</em>\r\n  \r\n  It was a surprisingly diverse crowd. I expected to see mostly clones of Ben and I, but there was a wide range of ages and styles. Most surprisingly were more than just a few women -- there were a lot more ladies present than any Ae show I've been to in the past. Great! Everyone seemed friendly and mellow.\r\n  \r\n  Rob Hall wrapped up his set around 10:15pm, then it was time for Cygnus to take the stage.\r\n  \r\n  <img src=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/images/profiles/cygnus.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\">\r\n  <em>Cygnus</em>\r\n  \r\n  Cygnus is Phillip Washington, formerly known as Central Processing Unit. He put on a lively show, grooving out behind his equipment as he punched tracks in and out of the mix and twiddled knobs to transform the sound this way and that. Things started in a cool and straightforward way, but by mid-set things had gotten really deep and driving. It was a good evolution from Rob Hall's setlist, and set a vector to Autechre's mayhem.\r\n  I've since bought a couple of Cygnus' releases on iTunes and have listened many times. His latest EP called \"Radical User Interfaces\" is awesome.\r\n  \r\n  Cygnus wrapped up and surprisingly Rob Hall came back on and played some tracks. It was almost midnight at this point.\r\n  \r\n  The multicolor, perpetually moving club lights that had been in full effect for the duration of the show so far went black. There was just a single blacklight fixture in the middle of the room that stayed on, but that mistake was soon corrected and it was powered down. \r\n  \r\n  We were left without visuals to plant any imagery in our minds. There were no lights on the stage either. Just from some ambient glow, I saw the baseball cap of Autechre's Sean Booth peeking out from behind his MacBook Pro, and his fingers busy doing who knows what. He must have snuck onto the stage, hunched over so nobody could see. Slowly but surely, he seized control of the sound from DJ Rob Hall, manipulating the recorded track with effects surely from centuries in the future. He took what was an already abstract track, and did things with it that made the original seem positively bland. It's such a challenge to describe what the sounds were at this point -- words cannot possibly capture the moebius of sounds and tones in that room.\r\n  \r\n  <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Autechre.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\">\r\n  <em>Autechre</em>\r\n  \r\n  As the magic was getting into full swing, another figure appeared on stage. It was Rob Brown -- the other half of Autechre. He swung his backpack off his shoulder, pulled out his laptop, opened it up, and plugged it into the club's sound system (and who knows what else).\r\n  \r\n  From here on out, it was all Autechre. Imagine a dark room, filled to legal capacity. A huge sound system pumping out noises that you have never heard before and probably will never hear again. Nothing to look at other than what happened to pop into your mind (and sometimes that damn nerd next to you SSHing on his Android phone. anyhow...)\r\n  \r\n  They didn't play any songs from any of their two dozen or more albums and EPs. It was all new and unique, and totally catered to a room with a giant sound system. The sound was so crystal clear, so deep, so physically engaging. One standout track was mostly comprised of a hammering, deep, clipped bass sound. Over and over and over it pounded, with little flourishes of higher spectral noise peppered in rhythmically. The music wasn't so much what we were hearing (and feeling -- literally from head to toe) but rather the spaces between the sounds.\r\n  \r\n  Autechre's music rewards patience and perseverance. There's always beat in there, but sometimes it's hard to find. They'll sometimes throw us a bone with a snare here or a drop there right on the beat. But for the most part, focus and feel are the best guides to really understand what they're trying to convey. Feel was a huge part of the experience. They made full use of the booming system at Mezzanine, which transformed it from a pure listening experience to one involving your whole body. Bliss.\r\n  \r\n  After a short hour, they disappeared as quietly as they arrived. I could have listened for another seven hours though!\r\n  \r\n  DJ Rob Hall came back on and kept the music going. The crowd thinned out considerably. Ben and I were both hoping this was some kind of intermission, but alas the show was over.\r\n  \r\n  We walked back to Ben's house in China Basin, and I drove home, getting back at 3am (!!!).\r\n  \r\n  What Autechre does with sound is absolutely unique. Modifying dozens of dimensions of dozens of tracks continuously, while keeping it musical and organic is absolute genius on display. Nobody else in music comes anywhere close to their technical and artistic abilities. Most electronic music is rooted in repetition, which after listening to anything Autechre's released in the last 10 years just seems like laziness. They've been doing this since the early 1990s, and have remained top innovators without exception.\r\n  \r\n  Come back soon guys!\r\n  \r\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H6pqLWtfv_g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>\r\n  <em>YJY UX  from Autechre's 2013 album Exai.

Everything aligned for a trip there today!\n  \n  We took BART into the city from Fremont, then it was a quick walk to the Hyatt Regency to check out that awesome hotel, and its views and elevators. We then made a beeline to Enjoy Vegetarian for a very tasty lunch (&quot;the best Chinese food I've ever had!&quot; said Marina), then did a lot of shopping. The girls were on a parasol mission, and that mission was accomplished. Another trip back through the Hyatt for a bathroom break and some hot chocolate, then back on the train.\n  \n  It was a really fun day that felt like we were a world away, but still in our own neighborhood.\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1608/24160826785_e50318bc02_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :title: Love these girls\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 16:30:40\n  :id: \"24160826785\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1608/24160826785_e50318bc02_s.jpg\n- :title: Transamerica Dwarves\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 12:27:41\n  :id: \"23532617864\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1468/23532617864_eb2179112c_s.jpg\n- :title: BART portrait\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 15:52:30\n  :id: \"24160848415\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1650/24160848415_30a7e1e420_s.jpg\n- :title: Hot chocolate overlooking ice skating\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 15:27:41\n  :id: \"23865212720\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1529/23865212720_58fee617e5_s.jpg\n- :title: Good Mong Kok Bakery Treat 2\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 14:36:32\n  :id: \"24134740016\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1531/24134740016_a3f0577b3e_s.jpg\n- :title: New Asia for Treat\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 14:24:11\n  :id: \"23534055463\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1694/23534055463_1f57427f3d_s.jpg\n- :title: Street Scene\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 14:06:45\n  :id: \"23532633634\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1652/23532633634_aae7cd5581_s.jpg\n- :title: Candidly\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 14:06:17\n  :id: \"23532633324\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1649/23532633324_ba17c06120_s.jpg\n- :title: Lanterns\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 13:29:33\n  :id: \"24052761092\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1685/24052761092_81701876f3_s.jpg\n- :title: Chinatown Alley\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 13:18:14\n  :id: \"24160838985\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1497/24160838985_a9d6c5bac5_s.jpg\n- :title: Lunch at Enjoy Vegetarian\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 13:15:07\n  :id: \"23865202340\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1712/23865202340_26bf1781c0_s.jpg\n- :title: Ferry Building\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 11:57:48\n  :id: \"23532626304\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1643/23532626304_7bf117a193_s.jpg\n- :title: Gazing at ... ?\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 11:55:27\n  :id: \"23865198580\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1547/23865198580_739dab2dc5_s.jpg\n- :title: Hyatt Regency Elevator\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 11:54:35\n  :id: \"24134726106\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1600/24134726106_8829c33699_s.jpg\n- :title: Headed Up\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 11:09:25\n  :id: \"24052750222\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1654/24052750222_93d81039f6_s.jpg\n- :title: Heading down\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 11:07:51\n  :id: \"23534039873\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1702/23534039873_2a27e702b7_s.jpg\n- :title: Time for some nail maintenance?\n  :description: Taken with NightCap Pro\n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 10:54:51\n  :id: \"24160827815\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1480/24160827815_e5d21b72e4_s.jpg\n- :title: Hanging around on BART\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-03 10:35:58\n  :id: \"23534035293\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1463/23534035293_d6e0c33e20_s.jpg\n:id: \"72157662443726259\"\n:num_photos: 18\n"

Things warmed up once we got to the other side of the ridge to our turnaround point at the Castle Rock campground. \n  \n  The return trip through the snowy trees turned to a slushball dodgefest. Super fun!\n  \n  Every run is always so unique!\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1444/24810823901_5a7baa83b4_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :title: So Lush\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-29 08:58:53\n  :id: \"24536572339\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1631/24536572339_535fdc5d99_s.jpg\n- :title: Frosty Ferns\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-31 07:57:47\n  :id: \"24904186915\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1452/24904186915_8e2206cb1d_s.jpg\n- :title: Nina and Beto check out the snow.\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-31 07:58:06\n  :id: \"24608708880\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1477/24608708880_7cbd6e3563_s.jpg\n- :title: Gazing up at snowy trunks.\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-31 08:09:55\n  :id: \"24810823901\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1444/24810823901_5a7baa83b4_s.jpg\n- :title: Valley fog, snowy leaves.\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-31 08:10:47\n  :id: \"24904181735\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1479/24904181735_dc0d868f5f_s.jpg\n- :title: Snowed in!\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-31 08:26:00\n  :id: \"24904692215\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1523/24904692215_b0195785df_s.jpg\n- :title: Castle Rock Trailhead, powder edition.\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-31 08:26:09\n  :id: \"24904695395\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1465/24904695395_ab044ee648_s.jpg\n- :title: Singletrack boulders.\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-31 08:33:33\n  :id: \"24904197435\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1562/24904197435_4ee47fef2f_s.jpg\n- :title: Fungus among us.\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-31 08:33:44\n  :id: \"24277300753\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1466/24277300753_e2b4dd598e_s.jpg\n- :title: Saratoga Gap Trail\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-31 08:46:48\n  :id: \"24536577579\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1491/24536577579_cc8f29905b_s.jpg\n- :title: Nina in her favorite place.\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-31 09:09:02\n  :id: \"24608712100\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1696/24608712100_11d8beba36_s.jpg\n- :title: Zack on Saratoga Gap Trail.\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-01-31 09:00:51\n  :id: \"24537428099\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1469/24537428099_6b1395bce8_s.jpg\n- :title: The Route\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-02-08 15:44:56\n  :id: \"24904869865\"\n  :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1468/24904869865_b1d038d8cb_s.jpg\n:id: \"72157663879097310\"\n:num_photos: 13\n"

Talk about variety! We started in a poison oak grove, then shifted to lush ferns and redwoods, climbing a sandy trail to a foggy lookout tower (with tasty water fountain), down a rocky trail back to redwoods, down to the San Lorenzo River for a thrilling knee-deep crossing, up the river, then crossing back where we saw a Pacific Lamprey attached to a rock. Back through giant clover fields and giant redwood fairy rings to the car. It's really a fantastic place that is easy to get to and has tons of trails for exploring.\n  \n  <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/554476949\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.strava.com/activities/554476949</a>\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1720/26533405361_f6bd2cf484_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1516/25996034063_a01902863d_s.jpg\n  :title: Beto zooms by ferns.\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 06:59:49\n  :id: \"25996034063\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1531/25996035423_d512737f63_s.jpg\n  :title: Blurrr\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 06:59:52\n  :id: \"25996035423\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1587/26533403871_c3180ac311_s.jpg\n  :title: Nina on the lookout\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 07:21:49\n  :id: \"26533403871\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1614/26533385281_b55e2c7a2b_s.jpg\n  :title: Foggy morning silouhettes\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 07:22:24\n  :id: \"26533385281\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1650/26573117936_60079a2834_s.jpg\n  :title: Detail in the shadows\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 07:26:38\n  :id: \"26573117936\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1606/25996040133_7b7c4ac8e8_s.jpg\n  :title: Fogbow!\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 07:35:42\n  :id: \"25996040133\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1494/25996040363_cc6fac7e19_s.jpg\n  :title: Sandy trail\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 07:37:43\n  :id: \"25996040363\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1536/26533391611_1dafeb840f_s.jpg\n  :title: Beto, go toward the light!\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 07:37:48\n  :id: \"26533391611\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1600/25996044603_df7dbe405f_s.jpg\n  :title: More Fogbow\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 08:16:27\n  :id: \"25996044603\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1586/26533399711_3cdc466ee1_s.jpg\n  :title: Nina's Pano\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 08:17:45\n  :id: \"26533399711\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1687/26533402541_a43ef5e6fc_s.jpg\n  :title: Silouhette and Jesus Light\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 08:24:57\n  :id: \"26533402541\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1513/26599127225_82b1c5ef23_s.jpg\n  :title: Ultimate Jesus Light\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 08:25:19\n  :id: \"26599127225\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1720/26533405361_f6bd2cf484_s.jpg\n  :title: Rays\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 08:25:38\n  :id: \"26533405361\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1515/26533413421_67fee930de_s.jpg\n  :title: River crossing\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 08:51:55\n  :id: \"26533413421\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1634/26533409191_0124c26dcc_s.jpg\n  :title: Pacific Lamprey\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 09:07:06\n  :id: \"26533409191\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1497/26506211922_4f23c15567_s.jpg\n  :title: Clover Field\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-04-23 09:22:16\n  :id: \"26506211922\"\n:id: \"72157667360328091\"\n"

I also love how it's really frugal -- one pump is really all you need to wash your hands. What I don't love are the pungent fragrances, even on \"natural\" products, or the price.\r\n  \r\n  So with some DIY we can do better, right? Yes!\r\n  \r\n  <div style=\"text-align:center\"><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/26705424815/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Homemade foaming hand soap.\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1706/26705424815_dac480d569.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Homemade foaming hand soap.\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n  \r\n  What you need to make your own foaming hand soap:\r\n  \r\n  <dl>\r\n  <dt>A dispenser</dt>\r\n  <dd>You can use an old dispenser (e.g. Method) or buy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/mDesign-Foaming-Dispenser-Bathroom-Accessory/dp/B019NS80R4\">a nice glass set</a>.\r\n  <dt>Distilled water</dt>\r\n  <dd>Buy a gallon at your local grocery store for a dollar.</dd>\r\n  <dt>Soap</dt>\r\n  <dd>Some other online recipes recommend Dr. Bronners Castille soap, which I mostly like except for the soapy \"aftertaste\" that seems to linger on your hands. At $12/32oz at Trader Joe's, it's also kind of expensive. I tried Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle shampoo ($4/16oz) and it works great, smells great, and when you rinse your hands there is no smell left at all. Winner!</dd>\r\n  <dt>Olive oil (optional)</dt>\r\n  <dd>Add a drop of olive oil to be friendly to the seals inside of the dispenser. I don't have any empirical evidence this makes a difference, but it doesn't appear to hurt.</dd>\r\n  </dl>\r\n  \r\n  <div style=\"text-align:center\"><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/26678910326/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Homemade foaming hand soap.\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1483/26678910326_e320f6ce39.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Homemade foaming hand soap.\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n  \r\n  It helps to have a kitchen scale to measure stuff out, but this isn't exact science - it's hand soap.\r\n  \r\n  <ol>\r\n  <li>Empty out the dispenser and rinse it out. Fill with water and pump it until it's mostly just water coming out (it will always be a tiny bit soapy, but again: not exact science).\r\n  <li>Assuming it's a 10oz container, fill with 8.5oz of distilled water.</li>\r\n  <li>Add 1.5oz of the Tea Tree Tingle.</li>\r\n  <li>Add a drop of the olive oil.</li>\r\n  <li>Screw the lid on the dispenser and swish it around, swirl it, invert it, spin your self around. That's what it's all about.</li>\r\n  <li>Pump it and marvel at your ability to create what once seemed impossible.</li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  A bottle of Method Foaming Hand Wash costs $3 at Target. This is a good price for the dispenser, so it may be worth buying one just to dump the smelly contents out.\r\n  \r\n  A refill using this recipe costs:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>$0.07 for the water</li>\r\n  <li>$0.37 for the shampoo</li>\r\n  <li>$0.000001 for the olive oil</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  For a grand total of $0.44, and it is exactly what I want. Done!\n:excerpt: |-\n  I really like foaming hand soap. I love how it goes on, and how easy it is to wash off.

  data: "--- \n:description: |-\n  As a work anniversary gift, Hoopla gives its employees an allowance toward a Blueboard.com gift. <a href=\"https://www.blueboard.com/\">Blueboard is an experiential concierge service</a>, so they work with you to put together a fun day from a wide range of choices. Working with them was a real pleasure, and I highly recommend their service.\r\n  \r\n  I had been talking with the girls about taking them on a trip to Alcatraz, so here was a great opportunity to have Blueboard purchase the tickets for me and set up reservations for a nice meal.\r\n  \r\n  We packed a small lunch and took BART from Fremont to Embarcadero station, then walked to Pier 33. We took our time and still got there with plenty of time to get a snack.\r\n  \r\n  The ferry ride to Alcatraz is pretty short. The word &quot;bored&quot; was never uttered by either of the girls.\r\n  \r\n  We chose to just explore the island on our own time, which was super fun. We wandered looking at the beautiful flowers and surprising bird life. There were gulls and cormorants nesting on the ground, and white herons nesting in trees only a few feet from the roads and paths.\r\n  \r\n  There were textures and colors everywhere. We had a great time, each of us armed with a camera, getting creative with our shots.\r\n  \r\n  It was really interesting to learn about Alcatraz's history first as a fortress, then a prison, then a site for Native Americans to protest their treatment by the US government. Evidence of all of these past lives is still present there.\r\n  \r\n  Inside the prison, the girls were both kind of weirded out by the inside of the prison, especially the cells. Pretty sure they'll lead a life far away from crime as a result.\r\n  \r\n  We were all pretty tired after walking around for two and a half hours, so we took the 4:15pm ferry back to San Francisco.\r\n  \r\n  Our favorite vegetarian Chinese restaurant Enjoy was less than a mile away, so we headed that way for an early-ish dinner. This was a loooooong walk for us all. Naomi got to ride on my shoulders for the last quarter mile. But once we got there, dinner was delicious as always. The fake meat is a real novelty for the girls.\r\n  \r\n  We made our way back to the Embarcadero and stopped off at Over The Moon for a treat. They make some amazing ice cream and serve it on cookies they make. Marina had honey lavender ice cream between two snickerdoodles, and Naomi had caramel cookie dough in a chocolate chip cookie bowl. Both were really really good.\r\n  \r\n  It was an easy ride back to the Fremont BART station, then a drive home and straight to bed.\r\n  \r\n  Naomi summed up the day just right: &quot;Awesome and exhausting.&quot; Yep.\n:primary_photo_id: \"26986206376\"\n:link: http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/sets/72157668100277682/\n:pub_date: 2016-05-14 14:18:07\n:photos: \n- :description: \n

This year was such an experience in learning, growth, and overcoming adversity.\r\n  \r\n  The story starts toward the end of last year when I started running with \"Club Nina\" -- a loosely organized group of about 20 local trail crazies led by the gregarious and motivated Nina G. My routine went from \"a couple short neighborhood runs during the week and a weekend trail run\" to \"pre-dawn weekday trail runs with Nina and friends and a longer weekend run.\" My weekly mileage went from 20 to 30 to 40 through this year, still only running three days a week. Since we were running trails, we were running hills, so my weekly elevation more than doubled too. Nina and I are well matched, not only in pace, but in our motivation for trail running. Feeling like a part of nature and observing its ever changing faces is a big part of why we choose to do this. Nina's enthusiasm for miles, feet, and nature photos have kept me honest in training for this race. Other friends in Club Nina share this zeal too, and so we all get along really well. It's been a real pleasure to get to know some of these folks like Beto, Jeremy, Jamey, Donnie, Paul, Alex, Larry, Matt, Jeff, Jeff, Tim, and others, and I hope that continues.\r\n  \r\n  Ok, back to the race...\r\n  \r\n  I've cut out most caffeine from my routine, which has the added benefit of making me really sensitive (in a good way!) to full-power coffee. Out of bed at 5am, popped a couple of ibuprofen to ensure my ankle that I rolled two days before on an easy taper run stayed pain-free, and into the kitchen to hit my secret stash of caffienated coffee. Nina came over at 6:45am, and I was feeling GOOD. I knew at that point that this would be a great racing day.\r\n  \r\n  We drove to near the trailhead and hiked up to the registration/start line. It's always so awesome to feel the energy of so many fellow trail crazies before Ohlone. It's the toughest 50K in this area, and so people are simultaneously excited and scared.\r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/27208489115/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Untitled\"><img src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7368/27208489115_8efe9040fe_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"322\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  We chatted with fellow Quicksilver Running Club members Jean, Johnny, Harris, Alex, and Kat, and met a few others.\r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/27175949296/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Quicksilver Running Club\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7526/27175949296_76b47925be_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Quicksilver Running Club\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  We lined up toward the front of the pack. \"Three, two, one, go!\" it was kind of a surprise start, but I was ready. I tried my best to stick with the lead pack in the first quarter mile where the trail is mostly flat. This is different than my approach from prior years where I would hang back at the start, with the intention of passing people up the hill. I liked this new approach, since it kept me from getting complacent with running with a pack of slower runners. There were only 8 other men in front of me, which was a really energizing feeling.\r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/27111865902/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Untitled\"><img src=\"https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7006/27111865902_73b316fc21_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  I ran for a bit with Erik from Germany/Switzerland in yellow shirt above. He told me about some Swiss races he had done, which sounded absolutely incredible. I'd love to get out to that part of the world one day.\r\n  \r\n  I made it to the top of Mission Peak on the 4.5 mile O50K route in about 52 minutes, which was a few minutes faster than I had ever done before, even on shorter runs. No slowing down at the top of the hill, I PR'd the rocky descent from the top of the peak as well as the flat singletrack behind the peak on the way to the Ohlone Wilderness Trail. Despite this pace, I was feeling really good, and didn't feel like I was pushing myself hard.\r\n  \r\n  I stopped for a quick gel and potato at the Laurel Loop aid station (mile 5.5) and to say hey to my friend Jerry, in the black jacket on the right side of this photo. Jerry taught me how to run fast downhill. Even at 68 years old, we were holding 6m20s pace down Mission Peak's steep slopes. Salud!\r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/26603222123/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Untitled\"><img src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7508/26603222123_d60728aec0_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  I was feeling great at this point, and was really surprised to hear Strava on my phone announce a couple of sub-7 minute mile splits. I was keeping the energy expenditure low, so I was stoked that I was keeping that pace.\r\n  \r\n  About 1.5 miles from Sunol (mile 8 in the race), I started to feel some burning from my left foot. It was a pre-blister feeling coming from the ball of my foot. I considered stopping to adjust my socks and shoes, but I decided instead to stop at the Sunol aid station and put some vaseline on that area and refill my water early -- I had been planning on waiting until the Backpack Area stop at mile 12.5. The vaseline didn't really help, and I felt like my foot was sliding around in my shoe even more. I stopped to tighten my forefoot laces thinking that would help. Eventually my foot went numb, which was fine with me. The numbness would occasionally subside, and that's when I proclaimed to myself that the foot pain was my \"cross to bear\" for this race and I needed to overcome it mentally. As the pain came and went, I managed to convince myself that the pain was helpful to me. It showed me I was still alive, and it let me know when my foot hit the ground. It went from a distracting aggravation to a helpful companion, as crazy as that sounds.\r\n  \r\n  If that wasn't enough, I started to feel a tinge of cramps in my inner thighs, calves, and quads throughout the rest of the race, starting at the steep wall climbing out of the Backpack Area (mile 12.5). \r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/27174745116/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Climbing out of the Backpack Area\"><img src=\"https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7049/27174745116_f46932e071_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Climbing out of the Backpack Area\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a>\r\n  <p class=\"caption\">Heading out from the Backpack Area aid station with a mouth full of salty potato. Photo by Vladimir Gusiatnikov.</p>\r\n  \r\n  The cramps were easily mitigated by taking salt capsules. For being a cool day, I went through a lot more salt than I ever had. I swallowed 9 capsules in total through the race, sometimes as little as 30 minutes apart. This is strange for me, and I'm curious what led to this condition. Previously, I wouldn't need more than 4 capsules, even on a hot day. Thankfully I had brought enough so as to not totally seize up in a writhing ball of cramp on the side of the trail.\r\n  \r\n  The Goat Rock aid station was at mile 15, and I stopped very briefly for a gel and potato. I didn't realize that Jesse D was volunteering there, otherwise I would have stopped for two more seconds to say hey! Hey Jesse!\r\n  \r\n  I ran a bit with a guy named John from Las Vegas who works in law enforcement for the Federal Government. He was on a tear, so he left me after a couple miles.\r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/27111903392/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Untitled\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7647/27111903392_4041a57751_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a>\r\n  <p class=\"caption\">The view from near Goat Rock</p>\r\n  \r\n  A mile or so before Rose Peak, a Fire Rescue truck motored past me on the trail. Damn, I thought, I really hope there isn't a medical problem with one of the runners ahead. Turns out they were just relocating from one aid station to another. *whew*\r\n  \r\n  \"Top o' the mountain to ye\" I shouted at the folks working the tent at the top of Rose Peak (mile 20) handing out bracelets. From there, the trail descends a bit to the Maggie's Half Acre aid station, which historically has been my favorite. This year didn't disappoint, with a bowl of fresh strawberries (YES! LIFE!) and some ice for my water.\r\n  \r\n  Let me take a moment to talk about the wonder of ice. Water is good, but ice cold water is incredible. Not only does it feel good in your mouth and throat, but it serves to lower your body temperature, and your intestines can absorb cold water faster than warm water. So take advantage of ice water whenever possible!\r\n  \r\n  A little while past Maggie's Half Acre, I decided that this numb foot thing was kind of silly, and perhaps I'd been tightening my shoes too much. I stopped to loosen them, and voila! Happy feet. This, combined with the strawberries and icewater gave me a very strong second wind. I was so happy to be out there on the beautiful trail, doing this thing that I had trained for the past 6 months. With a new spring in my step, I pressed on through the few remaining valleys and ridges between Rose Peak and Lake Del Valle.\r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/27111886842/in/album-72157668437475952/\" title=\" \"><img src=\"https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7636/27111886842_1d5a483f1a_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  I ran past the Stewart's Camp water faucet without stopping. Last year, this was a plumbed savior in the 110F heat, dispensing with ice cold, high pressure water that I basically took a shower in. This year, the ambient temperature barely cracked 70F, and I was on a mission to PR Ohlone! No stopping!\r\n  \r\n  I caught back up with Federal Law Enforcement John (I won't give more details in case this is sensitive information), and had a great time chatting. It was his first Ohlone, and he was looking good. When the trail got narrow and steep, I found some new speed and put some distance between him and I. Looking at the time, I did the quick math to see what my chances of coming in under 6 hours were. Given what was coming up, I knew it was pretty unlikely. But I was still stoked that I knew I'd finish in not much more than 6 hours, probably 6:15.\r\n  \r\n  The last climb is a doozie -- It's a bit less than a mile long, but it's as steep as 25% in some places. I figured out that if I put my hands on my mid-thighs and leaned far forward, I could transfer energy from my upper body into my legs and make the steep stuff a bit easier. At this point, my legs were slightly cramping, but I was out of salt (I had given one to another racer about a mile earlier), but I knew that the final aid stop was coming up in less than 1/2 mile so that was OK. I forgot to grab more salt at that stop, but I chugged a few cups of Sprite there, and pressed on the final 2 miles of steep downhill to the finish.\r\n  \r\n  The final sprint at the end is always awesome. The trail isn't too steep, so you can just go go go without having to put on the brakes. You can hear people cheering for runners finishing ahead of you, and that's such an energizing sensation. You come out of the trees, and the finish is right there. I crossed the line after 6h5m, a new personal best for me by almost 40 minutes.\r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/27139704921/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Finishing Sprint\"><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7329/27139704921_5e94df326b.jpg\" width=\"335\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Finishing Sprint\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a>\r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/27174675216/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Finishing\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7792/27174675216_30fb1facd6.jpg\" width=\"335\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Finishing\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a>\r\n  <p class=\"caption\">Finish Line. Photos by Keith Blom.</p>\r\n  \r\n  I got to meet race co-director Chiping Fu at the finish as he handed me my finisher's plank and goodie bag. Good times!\r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/27139705291/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Co-Race Director Chihping\"><img src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7132/27139705291_8181975493_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"536\" alt=\"Co-Race Director Chihping\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  I met Nina's sister Vinh too, who was there to drive us back to the start in Fremont. I said hi to BJB who was chilling with his post-race beer in a comfortable chair. He looked like he had been there for a while -- in fact he finished almost an hour earlier. He took first place in our 40-49 age group, even after running the Quicksilver 100K the prior weekend. Amazing!\r\n  \r\n  I hobbled over to the BBQ area find a cold drink and a cool place to wait for Nina to finish. Just after I filled a cup with ice water, I heard some cheering from the folks watching the finish. I looked over to see none other than Nina coming through the finish with a huge smile on her face! I yelped with delight, and ran over to welcome her. She was only a couple of minutes behind me, and was the first woman to finish -- in her first 50K ever! Double Amazing!\r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/26603570033/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Trail Partners\"><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7719/26603570033_3f8076fcff_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"535\" alt=\"Trail Partners\" class=\"img-responsive\"></a>\r\n  \r\n  We sat in the grass and relaxed and chatted for another hour or so with new and old friends. Vinh was so sweet to bring us food and drinks and give us a ride back to the car in Fremont. All of the people working at the aid stations, the people who marked the course in prior days, and the crew at the finish selflessly give their time to make for a first-class experience for the racers. Thanks for that!\r\n  \r\n  <center>\r\n  <iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no'  src='https://www.strava.com/activities/584968590/embed/c9df0479359cf2867904e784327e0973b2d8883f'></iframe>\r\n  </center>\r\n  \r\n  <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thenobot/27209664935/in/datetaken-public/\" title=\"Ohlone 50K Elevation Profile and Aid Stations\"><img src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7419/27209664935_d333d7954c_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"212\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"Ohlone 50K Elevation Profile and Aid Stations\"></a>\r\n  <p class=\"caption\">The elevation profile of the course and the aid station locations. Mission Peak (2500ft) is the first bump on the left, Rose Peak (3850ft) is the highest point. Overall there is about 8500 feet of climbing in this race.</p>\r\n  \r\n  The calm after the storm is always a mixed blessing. On one hand, the hard work is over. Without the pressure of a big race, there's a lot more flexiblility in weekly exercising activities. On the other hand, the level of fitness from doing consistent 24+ mile runs on the weekend is such a great feeling. There's balance in there somewhere, and I will find it. I *am* certainly looking forward to the 2017 Ohlone 50K and shooting to come in under six hours.\n:excerpt: \"\"\n:title: 2016 Ohlone 50K -- Caffeine and Blisters Edition\n"

We started at Dirty Habit for creative drinks and plates, then on to the SF Jazz Center to see Taylor McFerrin perform. It was a very intimate setting, with room for about 60-75 people. His famous dad, Bobby, was in attendance. Taylor did a lot of improvisation and created most of the tracks on the spot, layer by layer. He invited a friend of his from the audience on stage to improvise a song together. They once performed as the Hart Foundation, with Taylor on the keyboard and beats and his friend on vocals. The one hour set flew by, with Taylor's many styles and talents showcased -- including beatboxing while playing the keyboard. Afterward we all agreed that we should have been up and dancing for most of the set!\n:pub_date: 2016-06-17 19:56:54\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7403/27711490321_51d875f649_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7445/27786198115_351327b69c_s.jpg\n  :title: Up from the Powell St Station\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-17 17:56:39\n  :id: \"27786198115\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7403/27711490321_51d875f649_s.jpg\n  :title: Bobby McF\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-17 19:56:54\n  :id: \"27711490321\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7498/27174387214_bbd66d4562_s.jpg\n  :title: The Room\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-17 20:07:42\n  :id: \"27174387214\"\n:id: \"72157667284753884\"\n"

A quick and now familiar train ride and we surfaced at the Embarcadero station. We searched a bit for a memory card for Marina's camera (no dice) then went to the Ghiradelli store for a root beer float, then onward to Yerba Buena Gardens. Our original intent was to check out what was at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, but it was closed. SFMOMA recently reopened after a 3 year expansion, so on we went. The quantity of art there was pretty overwhelming. We took a little intermission from art viewing for lunch at Double Zero (great pizza). Naomi was kind of cooked afterward, but we traveled through MOMA's 7th floor anyway. Jananne Al-Ani's &quot;Shadow Sites II&quot; was a standout piece for me, and served as a nice resting spot for all of us. We made an impromptu call to head to the lounge at the Palace Hotel for a little refreshment. $4.50 club soda never tasted so good! All in all a very satisfying day for this father.\n:pub_date: 2016-06-19 15:14:25\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7570/27750430726_8cb3386680_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7295/27684214342_b580ed5a78_s.jpg\n  :title: Hand and flowers\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-18 19:51:58\n  :id: \"27684214342\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7417/27784557395_8722c5f753_s.jpg\n  :title: MOMA lobby\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 12:04:20\n  :id: \"27784557395\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7344/27750423816_2f3037ed3d_s.jpg\n  :title: \"Richard Serra\\xE2\\x80\\x99s \\\"Sequence\\\"\"\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 12:05:42\n  :id: \"27750423816\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7687/27684241312_4c550a9c01_s.jpg\n  :title: Over there\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 12:22:57\n  :id: \"27684241312\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7273/27506295640_bc4640e741_s.jpg\n  :title: Living Wall\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 12:26:16\n  :id: \"27506295640\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7494/27710101431_e81ca05a85_s.jpg\n  :title: Yerba Buena fountain\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 13:05:42\n  :id: \"27710101431\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7120/27784571195_a1aec906c5_s.jpg\n  :title: Jananne Al-Ani's \"Shadow Sites II\"\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 14:19:37\n  :id: \"27784571195\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7570/27750430726_8cb3386680_s.jpg\n  :title: Going down\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 15:14:25\n  :id: \"27750430726\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7428/27710104011_1502b79649_s.jpg\n  :title: And out\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 16:17:38\n  :id: \"27710104011\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7792/27784583605_7b55b000af_s.jpg\n  :title: Palace H2O\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 16:30:29\n  :id: \"27784583605\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7442/27173768693_7c5dce20d6_s.jpg\n  :title: Palace ceil\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 16:33:21\n  :id: \"27173768693\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7297/27172847654_f1deacfaff_s.jpg\n  :title: Loco Soda\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 16:43:28\n  :id: \"27172847654\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7411/27684241182_99ab236ce3_s.jpg\n  :title: BART Entropy\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 17:55:55\n  :id: \"27684241182\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7358/27710110741_35f22acbeb_s.jpg\n  :title: BART Entropy 2\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 17:58:11\n  :id: \"27710110741\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7182/27172844344_31ae3204c2_s.jpg\n  :title: Waiting for the train\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 18:00:25\n  :id: \"27172844344\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7442/27750438096_e3b8b7520a_s.jpg\n  :title: All fun and games\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 18:02:30\n  :id: \"27750438096\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7300/27175281353_723856865a_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-06-19 12:13:35\n  :id: \"27175281353\"\n:id: \"72157667282181834\"\n"

Well, today we lived the dream. I happily pedaled from a fairly compact position (non-adjustable seats and all) while the girls practiced &quot;accidentally falling&quot; into the water. It was a hot day, so the girls were on cloud nine. I was hoping we'd get tossed out of the lake due to all the shenanigans, but alas we made a full circuit of the lake under daddy-power. Happy to oblige, girls! After returning to land, we got a cold treat then went to play at one of the playgrounds, then to the creek running through the park. We heard someone playing the clarinet in the distance and went to investigate. Just our luck that there's a weekly summer concert program at Vasona and we were just in time to hear 'The Klezmakers' put on a Klezmer show. Awesome luck! We got hungry though and returned home to make dosas then watch Castle in the Sky. Fun day!\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7457/27295175133_4f299d28ae_m.jpg\n:id: \"72157670244746135\"\n"

Very mellow, mostly comfortable, great scenery. Don't plan on a full night's sleep though.\n  - Super deluxe house with all the amenities.\n  - Singletrack mountain bike rides to canyons, waterfalls, and lava cones.\n  - The clearest water ever kayaking Spring River.\n  - Nightly Olympics viewing on the huge screen TV downstairs.\n  - Tuna sandwiches!\n  - Everybody pitched in and cooked a dinner. Super good.\n  - Best float ever.\n  - Hot afternoon river dips (literally took my breath away) alternating with sunny hot riverbank baking.\n  - Girls spending tons of quality time with cousins, mostly in the hot tub.\n:pub_date: 2016-08-11 14:11:09\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8800/28927753181_45eb8d2fcd_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :thumb_url:

Normally we would take BART, but I wanted to try our luck at driving. We met up with our friends there, and had a great time in this absolutely magnificent museum. There was incredible marine life on display, earthquake simulations, Native American pottery and jewelry, and a rainforest we could walk through. Highly recommended way to spend the day!\n:pub_date: 2016-08-14 21:10:15\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8645/28993893945_9ecbfb97f5_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8858/28374526874_6c40473768_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 11:11:14\n  :id: \"28374526874\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8210/28888697662_05a207fa50_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 11:23:25\n  :id: \"28888697662\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8416/28374524054_eca146e334_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 11:31:46\n  :id: \"28374524054\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7570/28888694942_1fee36a6ab_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 11:32:05\n  :id: \"28888694942\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8615/28993901295_697be0f56a_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 12:36:04\n  :id: \"28993901295\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8329/28376841673_cc224939b7_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 12:40:54\n  :id: \"28376841673\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8669/28707885240_42675305d2_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 12:43:48\n  :id: \"28707885240\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8528/28888692972_daf7e22428_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 13:03:55\n  :id: \"28888692972\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8701/28888703482_74b8880f54_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 13:16:41\n  :id: \"28888703482\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8174/28707883890_d44ec5772c_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 13:25:23\n  :id: \"28707883890\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8390/28888711452_d1306f680c_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 13:28:00\n  :id: \"28888711452\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8866/28376839373_4a67f897d3_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 14:18:34\n  :id: \"28376839373\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8476/28374528484_601420b417_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 14:34:13\n  :id: \"28374528484\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7551/28707891620_c6283ab537_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 15:09:38\n  :id: \"28707891620\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8763/28917652331_a2afe0575c_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 15:44:13\n  :id: \"28917652331\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8687/28374527464_d82989fa5f_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 16:11:50\n  :id: \"28374527464\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8893/28993907405_66c440c82e_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 16:18:37\n  :id: \"28993907405\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8827/28376845463_c4a99c304b_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 16:28:33\n  :id: \"28376845463\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8897/28707888130_d0561b7e47_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 16:29:40\n  :id: \"28707888130\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7498/28993900495_591063f20a_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 16:36:41\n  :id: \"28993900495\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8645/28993893945_9ecbfb97f5_s.jpg\n  :title: \n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-08-14 21:10:15\n  :id: \"28993893945\"\n:id: \"72157672469339615\"\n"

The last time I ran on that trail, there was a family of deer foraging at the lake basin, so surely it would be good for a kid-venture!\n  \n  To get there, park on Stevens Canyon Road just after it crosses Stevens Creek. There's a gate and some warnings about launching boats, though I'm not sure how anyone would launch a boat there.\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8722/29177941950_5702be84d7_m.jpg\n:photos: \n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7714/29466424625_e6858c0d08_s.jpg\n  :title: Abbey Road?\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 17:42:10\n  :id: \"29466424625\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8440/29386870491_852949bc67_s.jpg\n  :title: Excitement Builds\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 17:44:27\n  :id: \"29386870491\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8380/29466434175_72c31c87f6_s.jpg\n  :title: Heading to the light\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 17:46:17\n  :id: \"29466434175\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7513/29432184126_3183bf3555_s.jpg\n  :title: Friends\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 17:49:55\n  :id: \"29432184126\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8006/29466424165_2224373486_s.jpg\n  :title: Playing in the Sticks\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 17:53:46\n  :id: \"29466424165\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8610/29466427055_94a4c135be_s.jpg\n  :title: Marina and her BFF\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 18:03:17\n  :id: \"29466427055\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8018/29466421005_316ed7992f_s.jpg\n  :title: BFF returned to his habitat\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 18:06:05\n  :id: \"29466421005\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8157/29432183766_76e992be33_s.jpg\n  :title: Muddy\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 18:06:46\n  :id: \"29432183766\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8638/29466420435_0cf73c6b1e_s.jpg\n  :title: Grassy\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 18:08:36\n  :id: \"29466420435\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8401/29466425925_99cb349d55_s.jpg\n  :title: Naomi Ponders\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 18:16:00\n  :id: \"29466425925\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8722/29177941950_5702be84d7_s.jpg\n  :title: Woodland Creatures\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 18:16:44\n  :id: \"29177941950\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8147/29177945650_bf5918188e_s.jpg\n  :title: Projects\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 18:20:52\n  :id: \"29177945650\"\n- :thumb_url: http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8506/29432187056_a57868d949_s.jpg\n  :title: Finished Work\n  :description: \n  :pub_date: 2016-09-04 18:23:44\n  :id: \"29432187056\"\n:id: \"72157673433865645\"\n"

What an awesome trail! It ascends from the redwoods to a more desert-like exposed ridge with views of other exposed sandstones on nearby ridges.\n  \n  We continued the climb on the Howard King trail, which leads to the park HQ.\n  \n  After a quick pit stop (Its-It and espresso for me!) we headed back toward the coast on the Skyline to the Sea Trail. We put in a couple of fast miles after the trail turned downhill -- so much fun! \n  \n  The trail passes Berry Creek Falls after a few miles, and we couldn't pass up the opportunity to take a detour up the falls. There are actually two other falls above Berry Creek Falls that are absolutely stunning to look at and rinse off in.\n  \n  We finished out the run, returning to Waddell Beach. Thomas insisted we touch sea water to complete the run. I took him a bit too seriously and dove headfirst into the surf. It was literally a breathtaking experience, but so worth it!\n  \n  After toweling off and changing into a  dry shirt, we drove to The Roadhouse in Davenport for a really excellent lunch. It was my first hamburger in 8 years and it was deeply satisfying.\n  \n  Thanks Nina, Amy, Sachin, and Thomas for helping to make such a memorable day.\n:primary_photo_url:

  data: "--- \n:content: |-\n  For me, music-making has two phases -- sound-making and song-making. These are two very different disciplines. Sound-making is fun and spontaneous. Song-making can be those things too, but it also becomes extremely detailed and deliberate as the song inches closer to its final version.\r\n  \r\n  Sound-making exists in many forms. It may be a playable instrument sculpted inside of a synthesizer, where sound-generators produce waveforms that are modified and shaped by other processing units. It may be an existing recording, be it a movie, music, or anything else, then chopped up and placed in a sampler to be held indefinitely until called upon to play again. It may be a sound made here at home or in some faraway place, created and recorded with the sole purpose of being used in a composition in the future.\r\n  \r\n  Song-making assembles the prior work of sound-making, and organizes it into a composition. Songs are layers of sounds. Keys, chords, rhythmic patterns, notes, effects, and changes in all of those things through time are the focus in song-making. Because of the complicated intertwined nature of the sounds in a song, a deep focus really helps here. For me, song-making can only really happen if I know I have at least 8 hours of contiguous time to devote to it. The more the better.\r\n  \r\n  A typical song takes me 20-40 hours of song-making time. I may have only spent a couple hours with sound-making, or I may have spent a month collecting and producing sounds. Only when there is an emotional reason coupled with inspiration from the toolkit of sounds can a song happen.\r\n  \r\n  Here's part of what it looks like when it's done...\r\n  <img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://steinkamp.us/system/20170515-sound_post/whole_song.png\"/>\r\n  The horizontal rows are different sounds or instruments. Time passes from left to right. The lines and curves in this image are different parameters of the sound or instrument that will change over time. These parameters may be as simple as the loudness of the sound, or as nuanced as the level of resonance in a particular filter within a complex subtractive synthesizer.  Any and all of these thousands of possible parameters can be \"automated\" or controlled by drawing lines on the screen. This is where a lot of my time goes in song-making.\n:thumb_url: https://steinkamp.us/system/20170515-sound_post/whole_song.png\n:title: Sound Making vs. Song Making\n:excerpt: For me, music-making has two phases -- sound-making and song-making. These are two very different disciplines. Sound-making is fun and spontaneous. Song-making can be those things too, but it also becomes extremely detailed and deliberate as the song inches closer to its final version.\n"

  data: "--- \n:content: \"It was a Thursday night. I was sound-making. I had an idea to get some sounds from my kitchen. Maybe something with a bowl. Maybe dropping something on the floor. Silverware can make some cool sounds. I had my Rode i-XY plugged into my phone. The Rode i-XY is a stereo mic with integrated app. It records with great detail and clarity, and it\\xE2\\x80\\x99s pretty straightforward to move recordings to my computer using FTP (though AirDrop would be even easier).\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <img src=\\\"/system/20170515-sound_post/rode_ixy.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive\\\"/>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  As I walked into the kitchen, the sliding door caught my eye. Hmm, glass has a cool sound -- and a big piece of glass might have a really cool sound. So I spent some time [carefully] hitting the glass in different ways with my fist, and with the i-XY in different positions, recording all the time.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  I was really curious what this might sound like, so I transferred the recording from my phone to my computer. The result was way more awesome than in real life. It was this huge and deep sound. Very powerful!\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Once the next opportunity for song-making opened up, I knew that this Window Drum would be one of the sounds to use. I worked from 6pm to 5am on a Friday, then again from 10am to 4pm on the song. It was really coming together, using some synth sounds, basic sine waves, recordings of the house floor, recordings of my bike, and some incredible sounds that Bahar made on her daff (a Persian drum that is kind of like a two foot diameter tambourine). It was all sounding great.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  I bounced the project to an AIFF file and uploaded it to SoundCloud so I could listen to it in different places. This is a very important part of song-making that not too many people talk about. A song that sounds awesome in a studio on expensive speakers may not sound great in the car, or in the kitchen, or on the tiny speaker on your phone. It\\xE2\\x80\\x99s important to audition a mix on many different devices and make small adjustments to come up with a good compromise.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Another reason to audition on different systems is to expose flaws. That\\xE2\\x80\\x99s what happened here.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The Window Drum was absolutely booming on my expensive studio speakers. I then took it to my living room where I have a nice setup, but the bottom end is taken care of by a single subwoofer. Both the left and right channels go into the subwoofer, the bass component of the sound is merged to mono and sent through its amplifier and out the big speaker, and the remaining signal is passed through to the left and right speakers.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  On my living room setup, the sound was lifeless. The top end was great, but the bottom end was completely missing. Gone.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Taking a look at the Window Drum sound up close told the whole story:\\r\\n\\\n  <img src=\\\"/system/20170515-sound_post/before.png\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive\\\"/>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  You can see in the image that the left and right channels were almost perfectly out of phase. The left and right channels recorded by the i-XY were picking up the window at different locations since the mic was so close to the window, and since it was vibrating, different phases. When this signal was merged down to mono by the subwoofer, the sounds were canceling each other out. Flatline.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  So the dilemma here: How to preserve the cool spatial quality of the sound and have a booming bottom end?\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Well, we mostly get spatial information from higher frequencies. It\\xE2\\x80\\x99s difficult for us humans to pinpoint the location of a deep bass sound, but we are very good at pointing to a bird chirping in a tree. If I could separate the high and low frequencies from the sound, I could keep the high frequencies spread in stereo, and at the same time do something to the bass to bring it in phase.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  The solution was to split the output on this track to two busses. Bus A would be dedicated to treble. Bus B would be for bass. \\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <img src=\\\"/system/20170515-sound_post/sends.png\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive\\\"/>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Bus A was simple to make -- just an EQ with a hard low-cut. I chose 75Hz \\xE2\\x80\\xA6 just because. \\r\\n\\\n  <img src=\\\"/system/20170515-sound_post/treble_eq.png\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive\\\"/>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Bus B had a similar but opposite EQ, with a high-cut set to 75Hz, and a few dB of boost on the bottom end for reasons that will soon be clear.\\r\\n\\\n  <img src=\\\"/system/20170515-sound_post/bass_eq.png\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive\\\"/>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  If I made Bus B a mono channel, Logic would sum the left and right signals together and I\\xE2\\x80\\x99d be back at square one with no bass. I had the idea that I could pan Bus B hard left (could have just as well have been right) so that only the left channel would be represented. This channel was routed to a third bus, set up to be mono. Since only the left channel of the original was used, this mono bass channel would not have any phasing issues.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <img src=\\\"/system/20170515-sound_post/mixer.png\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive\\\"/>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  This seemed to do the trick. After some tweaks in the EQ and volume to bring the bass energy back to the low-end, the it sounded great in the living room. You can see by this close-up of the tail of the sound, that it\\xE2\\x80\\x99s now mostly in-phase.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <img src=\\\"/system/20170515-sound_post/after.png\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive\\\"/>\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  Listening to it back to back with the original reveals some difference, but the final product is still spacious and powerful, but it holds up well in less-than-ideal listening environments.\\r\\n\\\n  \\r\\n\\\n  <dl>\\r\\n\\\n  <dt>Before:</dt>\\r\\n\\\n  <dd><audio controls><source src=\\\"/system/20170515-sound_post/clean.wav\\\"></audio><dd>\\r\\n\\\n  <dt>After:</dt>\\r\\n\\\n  <dd><audio controls><source src=\\\"/system/20170515-sound_post/bounced.wav\\\"></audio></dd>\\r\\n\\\n  </dl>\\r\\n\\\n  Have a listen to this sound in a full composition, starting at around 0:27:\\r\\n\\\n  <iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/322043366&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\\\"></iframe>\"\n:thumb_url: /system/20170515-sound_post/mixer.png\n:title: The Window Drum Dilemma\n:excerpt: Ever have a deep bass sound that's stunning in the studio, but falls flat on \"regular\" speakers?

Naomi chose her friend Donya, who came bundled with her mom (and my good friend) Bahar.\n  \n  The Honua Kai isn't getting old, and we decided to call it home again this year.\n  \n  All in all, this was a really fantastic vacation. None of us wanted to come home after a week of waves, wind, sun, pools, culture, and food.\n:primary_photo_url: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4287/35443886130_12ea9c9709_m.jpg\n:photos: \n-

  data: "---\n:thumb_url: ''\n:content: ! \"If you use docker-compose to run an app, more than likely you use container\n  links in the form of \\\"depends_on:\\\" in your docker-compose.yml, like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n<code>services:\\r\\n\n  \\ api:\\r\\n    build: .\\r\\n <strong>   depends_on:\\r\\n      - db</strong>\\r\\n    ports:\\r\\n\n  \\     - \\\"8080:8080\\\"\\r\\n  db:\\r\\n    image: postgres:9.6-alpine\\r\\n    ports:\\r\\n\n  \\     - \\\"5432:5432\\\"\\r\\n    environment:\\r\\n      - POSTGRES_USER=user\\r\\n      -\n  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass\\r\\n      - POSTGRES_DB=db\\r\\n</code>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem is\n  that your app (\\\"api\\\" in the example above) will start immediately after the command\n  to start \\\"db\\\" and \\\"redis\\\" is invoked. If the service you depend on takes time\n  to start -- maybe you are setting up a DB schema or seeding data -- and your app\n  tries to connect right away, then it may fail to start or you may see unnecessary\n  errors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solution to this problem is to have your app wait for the service\n  it depends on to actually become available. If this can be determined by the ability\n  to establish a TCP connection to that service, then you can use Linux's built-in\n  networking capabilities to do this test for you. No need to install any utilities!\\r\\n\\r\\n<code>services:\\r\\n\n  \\ api:\\r\\n    build: .\\r\\n   depends_on:\\r\\n      - db\\r\\n    ports:\\r\\n      -\n  \\\"8080:8080\\\"\\r\\n    <strong>command: |\\r\\n      /bin/bash -c 'while ! `(echo >\n  /dev/tcp/db/5432) >/dev/null 2>/dev/null`\\r\\n      do\\r\\n        echo \\\"Waiting\n  for db to become available...\\\"\\r\\n        sleep 1\\r\\n      done\\r\\n      NODE_ENV=production\n  node app.js'</strong>\\r\\n  db:\\r\\n    image: postgres:9.6-alpine\\r\\n    ports:\\r\\n\n  \\     - \\\"5432:5432\\\"\\r\\n    environment:\\r\\n      - POSTGRES_USER=user\\r\\n      -\n  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass\\r\\n      - POSTGRES_DB=db\\r\\n</code>\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this technique,\n  you can test for the availability of any TCP port before actually starting your\n  app.\"\n:title: Waiting For a Service to Actually Become Available in docker-compose\n:excerpt: ''\n"
